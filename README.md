| **[Confidential Serverless Computing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.21518v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although serverless computing offers compelling cost and deployment simplicity advantages, a significant challenge remains in securely managing sensitive data as it flows through the network of ephemeral function executions in serverless computing environments within untrusted clouds. While Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs) offer a promising secure execution environment, their integration with serverless architectures currently faces fundamental limitations in key areas: security, performance, and resource efficiency. We present WALLET, a confidential computing system for secure serverless deployments to overcome these limitations. By employing nested confidential execution and a decoupled guest OS within CVMs, WALLET runs each function in a minimal "trustlet", significantly improving security through a reduced Trusted Computing Base (TCB). Furthermore, by leveraging a data-centric I/O architecture built upon a lightweight LibOS, WALLET optimizes network communication to address performance and resource efficiency challenges. Our evaluation shows that compared to CVM-based deployments, WALLET has 4.3x smaller TCB, improves end-to-end latency (15-93%), achieves higher function density (up to 907x), and reduces inter-function communication (up to 27x) and function chaining latency (16.7-30.2x); thus, WALLET offers a practical system for confidential serverless computing.</p></details> |  |
| **[PIM-Enclave: Bringing Confidential Computation Inside Memory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03307v1)** | 2023-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Demand for data-intensive workloads and confidential computing are the prominent research directions shaping the future of cloud computing. Computer architectures are evolving to accommodate the computing of large data better. Protecting the computation of sensitive data is also an imperative yet challenging objective; processor-supported secure enclaves serve as the key element in confidential computing in the cloud. However, side-channel attacks are threatening their security boundaries. The current processor architectures consume a considerable portion of its cycles in moving data. Near data computation is a promising approach that minimizes redundant data movement by placing computation inside storage. In this paper, we present a novel design for Processing-In-Memory (PIM) as a data-intensive workload accelerator for confidential computing. Based on our observation that moving computation closer to memory can achieve efficiency of computation and confidentiality of the processed information simultaneously, we study the advantages of confidential computing \emph{inside} memory. We then explain our security model and programming model developed for PIM-based computation offloading. We construct our findings into a software-hardware co-design, which we call PIM-Enclave. Our design illustrates the advantages of PIM-based confidential computing acceleration. Our evaluation shows PIM-Enclave can provide a side-channel resistant secure computation offloading and run data-intensive applications with negligible performance overhead compared to baseline PIM model.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoVE: Towards Confidential Computing on RISC-V Platforms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.06167v1)** | 2023-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-tenant computing platforms are typically comprised of several software and hardware components including platform firmware, host operating system kernel, virtualization monitor, and the actual tenant payloads that run on them (typically in a virtual machine, container, or application). This model is well established in large scale commercial deployment, but the downside is that all platform components and operators are in the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) of the tenant. This aspect is ill-suited for privacy-oriented workloads that aim to minimize the TCB footprint. Confidential computing presents a good stepping-stone towards providing a quantifiable TCB for computing. Confidential computing [1] requires the use of a HW-attested Trusted Execution Environments for data-in-use protection. The RISC-V architecture presents a strong foundation for meeting the requirements for Confidential Computing and other security paradigms in a clean slate manner. This paper describes a reference architecture and discusses ISA, non-ISA and system-on-chip (SoC) requirements for confidential computing on RISC-V Platforms. It discusses proposed ISA and non-ISA Extension for Confidential Virtual Machine for RISC-V platforms, referred to as CoVE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine Learning with Confidential Computing: A Systematization of Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.10134v3)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Privacy and security challenges in Machine Learning (ML) have become increasingly severe, along with ML's pervasive development and the recent demonstration of large attack surfaces. As a mature system-oriented approach, Confidential Computing has been utilized in both academia and industry to mitigate privacy and security issues in various ML scenarios. In this paper, the conjunction between ML and Confidential Computing is investigated. We systematize the prior work on Confidential Computing-assisted ML techniques that provide i) confidentiality guarantees and ii) integrity assurances, and discuss their advanced features and drawbacks. Key challenges are further identified, and we provide dedicated analyses of the limitations in existing Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) systems for ML use cases. Finally, prospective works are discussed, including grounded privacy definitions for closed-loop protection, partitioned executions of efficient ML, dedicated TEE-assisted designs for ML, TEE-aware ML, and ML full pipeline guarantees. By providing these potential solutions in our systematization of knowledge, we aim to build the bridge to help achieve a much stronger TEE-enabled ML for privacy guarantees without introducing computation and system costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Surve...</summary><p>Survey paper, 37 pages, accepted to ACM Computing Surveys</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating the Performance of the DeepSeek Model in Confidential Computing Environment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11347v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in cloud environments raises critical security concerns, particularly regarding model confidentiality and data privacy. Confidential computing, enabled by Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), offers a promising solution to mitigate these risks. However, existing TEE implementations, primarily CPU-based, struggle to efficiently support the resource-intensive nature of LLM inference and training. In this work, we present the first evaluation of the DeepSeek model within a TEE-enabled confidential computing environment, specifically utilizing Intel Trust Domain Extensions (TDX). Our study benchmarks DeepSeek's performance across CPU-only, CPU-GPU hybrid, and TEE-based implementations. For smaller parameter sets, such as DeepSeek-R1-1.5B, the TDX implementation outperforms the CPU version in executing computations within a secure environment. It highlights the potential for efficiently deploying LLM models on resource-constrained systems while ensuring security. The overall GPU-to-CPU performance ratio averages 12 across different model sizes, with smaller models exhibiting a lower ratio. Additionally, we provide foundational insights and guidance on optimizing CPU-GPU confidential computing solutions for scalable and secure AI deployments. Our findings contribute to the advancement of privacy-preserving AI, paving the way for efficient and secure LLM inference in confidential computing environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Decentralized AI with Confidential Computing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13752v2)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses privacy protection in decentralized Artificial Intelligence (AI) using Confidential Computing (CC) within the Atoma Network, a decentralized AI platform designed for the Web3 domain. Decentralized AI distributes AI services among multiple entities without centralized oversight, fostering transparency and robustness. However, this structure introduces significant privacy challenges, as sensitive assets such as proprietary models and personal data may be exposed to untrusted participants. Cryptography-based privacy protection techniques such as zero-knowledge machine learning (zkML) suffers prohibitive computational overhead. To address the limitation, we propose leveraging Confidential Computing (CC). Confidential Computing leverages hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to provide isolation for processing sensitive data, ensuring that both model parameters and user data remain secure, even in decentralized, potentially untrusted environments. While TEEs face a few limitations, we believe they can bridge the privacy gap in decentralized AI. We explore how we can integrate TEEs into Atoma's decentralized framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI-Driven Confidential Computing across Edge-to-Cloud Continuum](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00928v1)** | 2023-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the meteoric growth of technology, individuals and organizations are widely adopting cloud services to mitigate the burdens of maintenance. Despite its scalability and ease of use, many users who own sensitive data refrain from fully utilizing cloud services due to confidentiality concerns. Maintaining data confidentiality for data at rest and in transit has been widely explored but data remains vulnerable in the cloud while it is in use. This vulnerability is further elevated once the scope of computing spans across the edge-to-cloud continuum. Accordingly, the goal of this dissertation is to enable data confidentiality by adopting confidential computing across the continuum. Towards this goal, one approach we explore is to separate the intelligence aspect of data processing from the pattern-matching aspect. We present our approach to make confidential data clustering on the cloud, and then develop confidential search service across edge-to-cloud for unstructured text data. Our proposed clustering solution named ClusPr, performs topic-based clustering for static and dynamic datasets that improves cluster coherency up to 30%-to-60% when compared with other encryption-based clustering techniques. Our trusted enterprise search service named SAED, provides context-aware and personalized semantic search over confidential data across the continuum. We realized that enabling confidential computing across edge-to-cloud requires major contribution from the edge tiers particularly to run multiple Deep Learning (DL) services concurrently. This raises memory contention on the edge tier. To resolve this, we develop Edge-MultiAI framework to manage Neural Network (NN) models of DL applications such that it can meet the latency constraints of the DL applications without compromising inference accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD D...</summary><p>PhD Dissertation advised by Dr. Mohsen Amini Salehi</p></details> |
| **[Confidential Machine Learning Computation in Untrusted Environments: A Systems Security Perspective](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03308v3)** | 2022-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As machine learning (ML) technologies and applications are rapidly changing many computing domains, security issues associated with ML are also emerging. In the domain of systems security, many endeavors have been made to ensure ML model and data confidentiality. ML computations are often inevitably performed in untrusted environments and entail complex multi-party security requirements. Hence, researchers have leveraged the Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to build confidential ML computation systems. We conduct a systematic and comprehensive survey by classifying attack vectors and mitigation in confidential ML computation in untrusted environments, analyzing the complex security requirements in multi-party scenarios, and summarizing engineering challenges in confidential ML implementation. Lastly, we suggest future research directions based on our study.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published to IEEE Access, URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9656734</p></details> |
| **[ACE: Confidential Computing for Embedded RISC-V Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12995v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential computing plays an important role in isolating sensitive applications from the vast amount of untrusted code commonly found in the modern cloud. We argue that it can also be leveraged to build safer and more secure mission-critical embedded systems. In this paper, we introduce the Assured Confidential Execution (ACE), an open-source and royalty-free confidential computing technology targeted for embedded RISC-V systems. We present a set of principles and a methodology that we used to build \ACE and that might be applied for developing other embedded systems that require formal verification. An evaluation of our prototype on the first available RISC-V hardware supporting virtualization indicates that ACE is a viable candidate for our target systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[HasTEE+ : Confidential Cloud Computing and Analytics with Haskell](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08901v1)** | 2024-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential computing is a security paradigm that enables the protection of confidential code and data in a co-tenanted cloud deployment using specialized hardware isolation units called Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). By integrating TEEs with a Remote Attestation protocol, confidential computing allows a third party to establish the integrity of an \textit{enclave} hosted within an untrusted cloud. However, TEE solutions, such as Intel SGX and ARM TrustZone, offer low-level C/C++-based toolchains that are susceptible to inherent memory safety vulnerabilities and lack language constructs to monitor explicit and implicit information-flow leaks. Moreover, the toolchains involve complex multi-project hierarchies and the deployment of hand-written attestation protocols for verifying \textit{enclave} integrity. We address the above with HasTEE+, a domain-specific language (DSL) embedded in Haskell that enables programming TEEs in a high-level language with strong type-safety. HasTEE+ assists in multi-tier cloud application development by (1) introducing a \textit{tierless} programming model for expressing distributed client-server interactions as a single program, (2) integrating a general remote-attestation architecture that removes the necessity to write application-specific cross-cutting attestation code, and (3) employing a dynamic information flow control mechanism to prevent explicit as well as implicit data leaks. We demonstrate the practicality of HasTEE+ through a case study on confidential data analytics, presenting a data-sharing pattern applicable to mutually distrustful participants and providing overall performance metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>High-...</summary><p>High-quality pdf at https://abhiroop.github.io/pubs/HasTEE_ESORICS_Sarkar_Russo.pdf</p></details> |
| **[Transparent Attested DNS for Confidential Computing Services](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14611v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential services running in hardware-protected Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) can provide higher security assurance, but this requires custom clients and protocols to distribute, update, and verify their attestation evidence. Compared with classic Internet security, built upon universal abstractions such as domain names, origins, and certificates, this puts a significant burden on service users and providers. In particular, Web browsers and other legacy clients do not get the same security guaranties as custom clients. We present a new approach for users to establish trust in confidential services. We propose attested DNS (aDNS): a name service that securely binds the attested implementation of confidential services to their domain names. ADNS enforces policies for all names in its zone of authority: any TEE that runs a service must present hardware attestation that complies with the domain-specific policy before registering keys and obtaining certificates for any name in this domain. ADNS provides protocols for zone delegation, TEE registration, and certificate issuance. ADNS builds on standards such as DNSSEC, DANE, ACME and Certificate Transparency. ADNS provides DNS transparency by keeping all records, policies, and attestations in a public append-only log, thereby enabling auditing and preventing targeted attacks. We implement aDNS as a confidential service using a fault-tolerant network of TEEs. We evaluate it using sample confidential services that illustrate various TEE platforms. On the client side, we provide a generic browser extension that queries and verifies attestation records before opening TLS connections, with negligible performance overhead, and we show that, with aDNS, even legacy Web clients benefit from confidential computing as long as some enlightened clients verify attestations to deter or blame malicious actors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Confidential High-Performance Computing in the Public Cloud](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.02378v1)** | 2022-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-Performance Computing (HPC) in the public cloud democratizes the supercomputing power that most users cannot afford to purchase and maintain. Researchers have studied its viability, performance, and usability. However, HPC in the cloud has a unique feature -- users have to export data and computation to somewhat untrusted cloud platforms. Users will either fully trust cloud providers to protect from all kinds of attacks or keep sensitive assets in-house instead. With the recent deployment of the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) in the cloud, confidential computing for HPC in the cloud is becoming practical for addressing users' privacy concerns. This paper discusses the threat models, unique challenges, possible solutions, and significant gaps, focusing on TEE-based confidential HPC computing. We hope this discussion will improve the understanding of this new topic for HPC in the cloud and promote new research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in IEEE Internet Computing</p></details> |
| **[CCxTrust: Confidential Computing Platform Based on TEE and TPM Collaborative Trust](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03842v3)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential Computing has emerged to address data security challenges in cloud-centric deployments by protecting data in use through hardware-level isolation. However, reliance on a single hardware root of trust (RoT) limits user confidence in cloud platforms, especially for high-performance AI services, where end-to-end protection of sensitive models and data is critical. Furthermore, the lack of interoperability and a unified trust model in multi-cloud environments prevents the establishment of a cross-platform, cross-cloud chain of trust, creating a significant trust gap for users with high privacy requirements. To address the challenges mentioned above, this paper proposes CCxTrust (Confidential Computing with Trust), a confidential computing platform leveraging collaborative roots of trust from TEE and TPM. CCxTrust combines the black-box RoT embedded in the CPU-TEE with the flexible white-box RoT of TPM to establish a collaborative trust framework. The platform implements independent Roots of Trust for Measurement (RTM) for TEE and TPM, and a collaborative Root of Trust for Report (RTR) for composite attestation. The Root of Trust for Storage (RTS) is solely supported by TPM. We also present the design and implementation of a confidential TPM supporting multiple modes for secure use within confidential virtual machines. Additionally, we propose a composite attestation protocol integrating TEE and TPM to enhance security and attestation efficiency, which is proven secure under the PCL protocol security model. We implemented a prototype of CCxTrust on a confidential computing server with AMD SEV-SNP and TPM chips, requiring minimal modifications to the TPM and guest Linux kernel. The composite attestation efficiency improved by 24% without significant overhead, while Confidential TPM performance showed a 16.47% reduction compared to standard TPM.</p></details> | 23 pages, 14 figures |
| **[ACAI: Protecting Accelerator Execution with Arm Confidential Computing Architecture](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15986v2)** | 2023-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trusted execution environments in several existing and upcoming CPUs demonstrate the success of confidential computing, with the caveat that tenants cannot securely use accelerators such as GPUs and FPGAs. In this paper, we reconsider the Arm Confidential Computing Architecture (CCA) design, an upcoming TEE feature in Armv9-A, to address this gap. We observe that CCA offers the right abstraction and mechanisms to allow confidential VMs to use accelerators as a first-class abstraction. We build ACAI, a CCA-based solution, with a principled approach of extending CCA security invariants to device-side access to address several critical security gaps. Our experimental results on GPU and FPGA demonstrate the feasibility of ACAI while maintaining security guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of the Usenix Security 2024 paper</p></details> |
| **[Confidential Computing in Edge-Cloud Hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.10834v1)** | 2023-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The paper introduces confidential computing approaches focused on protecting hierarchical data within edge-cloud network. Edge-cloud network suggests splitting and sharing data between the main cloud and the range of networks near the endpoint devices. The proposed solutions allow data in this two-level hierarchy to be protected via embedding traditional encryption at rest and in transit while leaving the remaining security issues, such as sensitive data and operations in use, in the scope of trusted execution environment. Hierarchical data for each network device are linked and identified through distinct paths between edge and main cloud using individual blockchain. Methods for data and cryptographic key splitting between the edge and the main cloud are based on strong authentication techniques ensuring the shared data confidentiality, integrity and availability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Formally Verified Security Monitor for VM-based Confidential Computing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.10249v3)** | 2023-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential computing is a key technology for isolating high-assurance applications from the large amounts of untrusted code typical in modern systems. Existing confidential computing systems cannot be certified for use in critical applications, like systems controlling critical infrastructure, hardware security modules, or aircraft, as they lack formal verification. This paper presents an approach to formally modeling and proving a security monitor. It introduces a canonical architecture for virtual machine (VM)-based confidential computing systems. It abstracts processor-specific components and identifies a minimal set of hardware primitives required by a trusted security monitor to enforce security guarantees. We demonstrate our methodology and proposed approach with an example from our Rust implementation of the security monitor for RISC-V.</p></details> |  |
| **[Confidential Federated Computations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10764v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning and Analytics (FLA) have seen widespread adoption by technology platforms for processing sensitive on-device data. However, basic FLA systems have privacy limitations: they do not necessarily require anonymization mechanisms like differential privacy (DP), and provide limited protections against a potentially malicious service provider. Adding DP to a basic FLA system currently requires either adding excessive noise to each device's updates, or assuming an honest service provider that correctly implements the mechanism and only uses the privatized outputs. Secure multiparty computation (SMPC) -based oblivious aggregations can limit the service provider's access to individual user updates and improve DP tradeoffs, but the tradeoffs are still suboptimal, and they suffer from scalability challenges and susceptibility to Sybil attacks. This paper introduces a novel system architecture that leverages trusted execution environments (TEEs) and open-sourcing to both ensure confidentiality of server-side computations and provide externally verifiable privacy properties, bolstering the robustness and trustworthiness of private federated computations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Confidential Computing across Edge-to-Cloud for Machine Learning: A Survey Study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.16447v1)** | 2023-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential computing has gained prominence due to the escalating volume of data-driven applications (e.g., machine learning and big data) and the acute desire for secure processing of sensitive data, particularly, across distributed environments, such as edge-to-cloud continuum. Provided that the works accomplished in this emerging area are scattered across various research fields, this paper aims at surveying the fundamental concepts, and cutting-edge software and hardware solutions developed for confidential computing using trusted execution environments, homomorphic encryption, and secure enclaves. We underscore the significance of building trust in both hardware and software levels and delve into their applications particularly for machine learning (ML) applications. While substantial progress has been made, there are some barely-explored areas that need extra attention from the researchers and practitioners in the community to improve confidentiality aspects, develop more robust attestation mechanisms, and to address vulnerabilities of the existing trusted execution environments. Providing a comprehensive taxonomy of the confidential computing landscape, this survey enables researchers to advance this field to ultimately ensure the secure processing of users' sensitive data across a multitude of applications and computing tiers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Confidential Truth Finding with Multi-Party Computation (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14727v1)** | 2023-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated knowledge discovery and data mining are challenged to assess the trustworthiness of data originating from autonomous sources while protecting confidentiality and privacy. Truth-finding algorithms help corroborate data from disagreeing sources. For each query it receives, a truth-finding algorithm predicts a truth value of the answer, possibly updating the trustworthiness factor of each source. Few works, however, address the issues of confidentiality and privacy. We devise and present a secure secret-sharing-based multi-party computation protocol for pseudo-equality tests that are used in truth-finding algorithms to compute additions depending on a condition. The protocol guarantees confidentiality of the data and privacy of the sources. We also present variants of truth-finding algorithms that would make the computation faster when executed using secure multi-party computation. We empirically evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol on two state-of-the-art truth-finding algorithms, Cosine, and 3-Estimates, and compare them with that of the baseline plain algorithms. The results confirm that the secret-sharing-based secure multi-party algorithms are as accurate as the corresponding baselines but for proposed numerical approximations that significantly reduce the efficiency loss incurred.</p></details> | <details><summary>15-pa...</summary><p>15-page extended version of a paper published at DEXA 2023</p></details> |
| **[Trusted Container Extensions for Container-based Confidential Computing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.05747v1)** | 2022-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud computing has emerged as a corner stone of today's computing landscape. More and more customers who outsource their infrastructure benefit from the manageability, scalability and cost saving that come with cloud computing. Those benefits get amplified by the trend towards microservices. Instead of renting and maintaining full VMs, customers increasingly leverage container technologies, which come with a much more lightweight resource footprint while also removing the need to emulate complete systems and their devices. However, privacy concerns hamper many customers from moving to the cloud and leveraging its benefits. Furthermore, regulatory requirements prevent the adaption of cloud computing in many industries, such as health care or finance. Standard software isolation mechanisms have been proven to be insufficient if the host system is not fully trusted, e.g., when the cloud infrastructure gets compromised by malicious third-party actors. Consequently, confidential computing is gaining increasing relevance in the cloud computing field. We present Trusted Container Extensions (TCX), a novel container security architecture, which combines the manageability and agility of standard containers with the strong protection guarantees of hardware-enforced Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to enable confidential computing for container workloads. TCX provides significant performance advantages compared to existing approaches while protecting container workloads and the data processed by them. Our implementation, based on AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV), ensures integrity and confidentiality of data and services during deployment, and allows secure interaction between protected containers as well as to external entities. Our evaluation shows that our implementation induces a low performance overhead of 5.77% on the standard SPEC2017 benchmark suite.</p></details> |  |
| **[Confidentiality without Encryption For Cloud Computational Privacy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1208.0070v1)** | 2012-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in technology has given rise to new computing models where any individual/organization (Cloud Service Consumers here by denoted as CSC's) can outsource their computational intensive tasks on their data to a remote Cloud Service Provider (CSP) for many advantages like lower costs, scalability etc. But such advantages come for a bigger cost "Security and Privacy of data" for this very reason many CSC's are skeptical to move towards cloud computing models. While the advances in cryptography research are promising, there are no practical solutions yet for performing any operations on encrypted data [1]. For this very reason there is strong need for finding alternative viable solutions for us to benefit from Cloud Computing. A technique to provide confidentiality without encryption was proposed in the past namely "Chaffing and Winnowing: Confidentiality without Encryption" by Ronald L. Rivest [2]. While this technique has been proposed for packet based communication system, its not adaptable in all cloud service models like Software-as-Service, Platform-as-Service or Infrastructure-as-Service [3]. In this paper we propose an adaptation of this technique in a cloud computational setup where CSC's outsource computational intensive tasks like web log parsing, DNA Sequencing etc to a MapReduce like CSP service.</p></details> | 3 pages, 2 figures |
| **[NVIDIA GPU Confidential Computing Demystified](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02770v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GPU Confidential Computing (GPU-CC) was introduced as part of the NVIDIA Hopper Architecture, extending the trust boundary beyond traditional CPU-based confidential computing. This innovation enables GPUs to securely process AI workloads, providing a robust and efficient solution for handling sensitive data. For end users, transitioning to GPU-CC mode is seamless, requiring no modifications to existing AI applications. However, this ease of adoption contrasts sharply with the complexity of the underlying proprietary systems. The lack of transparency presents significant challenges for security researchers seeking a deeper understanding of GPU-CC's architecture and operational mechanisms. The challenges of analyzing the NVIDIA GPU-CC system arise from a scarcity of detailed specifications, the proprietary nature of the ecosystem, and the complexity of product design. In this paper, we aim to demystify the implementation of NVIDIA GPU-CC system by piecing together the fragmented and incomplete information disclosed from various sources. Our investigation begins with a high-level discussion of the threat model and security principles before delving into the low-level details of each system component. We instrument the GPU kernel module -- the only open-source component of the system -- and conduct a series of experiments to identify the security weaknesses and potential exploits. For certain components that are out of reach through experiments, we propose well-reasoned speculations about their inner working mechanisms. We have responsibly reported all security findings presented in this paper to the NVIDIA PSIRT Team.</p></details> |  |
| **[CRC: Fully General Model of Confidential Remote Computing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03868v2)** | 2023-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital services have been offered through remote systems for decades. The questions of how these systems can be built in a trustworthy manner and how their security properties can be understood are given fresh impetus by recent hardware developments, allowing a fuller, more general, exploration of the possibilities than has previously been seen in the literature. Drawing on and consolidating the disparate strains of research, technologies and methods employed throughout the adaptation of confidential computing, we present a novel, dedicated Confidential Remote Computing (CRC) model. CRC proposes a compact solution for next-generation applications to be built on strong hardware-based security primitives, control of secure software products' trusted computing base, and a way to make correct use of proofs and evidence reports generated by the attestation mechanisms. The CRC model illustrates the trade-offs between decentralisation, task size and transparency overhead. We conclude the paper with six lessons learned from our approach, and suggest two future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Moreover, we exploit the asymmetric compute-and-forward decoding strategy to handle finite SNR regimes. Unlike previous alignment schemes, our achievable rates are attainable at any finite SNR value. Also, we show that our scheme achieves the optimal sum secure degrees of freedom of 1 for the K-receiver Gaussian broadcast channel with K confidential messages and K helpers.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, accepted to CISS 2017</p></details> |
| **[Cross-Chain Sealed-Bid Auctions Using Confidential Compute Blockchains](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19491v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sealed-bid auctions ensure fair competition and efficient allocation but are often deployed on centralized infrastructure, enabling opaque manipulation. Public blockchains eliminate central control, yet their inherent transparency conflicts with the confidentiality required for sealed bidding. Prior attempts struggle to reconcile privacy, verifiability, and scalability without relying on trusted intermediaries, multi-round protocols, or expensive cryptography. We present a sealed-bid auction protocol that executes sensitive bidding logic on a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)-backed confidential compute blockchain while retaining settlement and enforcement on a public chain. Bidders commit funds to enclave-generated escrow addresses, ensuring confidentiality and binding commitments. After the deadline, any party can trigger resolution: the confidential blockchain determines the winner through verifiable off-chain computation and issues signed settlement transactions for execution on the public chain. Our design provides security, privacy, and scalability without trusted third parties or protocol modifications. We implement it on SUAVE with Ethereum settlement, evaluate its scalability and trust assumptions, and demonstrate deployment with minimal integration on existing infrastructure</p></details> |  |
| **[virtCCA: Virtualized Arm Confidential Compute Architecture with TrustZone](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.11011v2)** | 2024-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ARM recently introduced the Confidential Compute Architecture (CCA) as part of the upcoming ARMv9-A architecture. CCA enables the support of confidential virtual machines (cVMs) within a separate world called the Realm world, providing protection from the untrusted normal world. While CCA offers a promising future for confidential computing, the widespread availability of CCA hardware is not expected in the near future, according to ARM's roadmap. To address this gap, we present virtCCA, an architecture that facilitates virtualized CCA using TrustZone, a mature hardware feature available on existing ARM platforms. Notably, virtCCA can be implemented on platforms equipped with the Secure EL2 (S-EL2) extension available from ARMv8.4 onwards, as well as on earlier platforms that lack S-EL2 support. virtCCA is fully compatible with the CCA specifications at the API level. We have developed the entire CCA software and firmware stack on top of virtCCA, including the enhancements to the normal world's KVM to support cVMs, and the TrustZone Management Monitor (TMM) that enforces isolation among cVMs and provides cVM life-cycle management. We have implemented virtCCA on real ARM servers, with and without S-EL2 support. Our evaluation, conducted on micro-benchmarks and macro-benchmarks, demonstrates that the overhead of running cVMs is acceptable compared to running normal-world VMs. Specifically, in a set of real-world workloads, the overhead of virtCCA-SEL2 is less than 29.5% for I/O intensive workloads, while virtCCA-EL3 outperforms the baseline in most cases.</p></details> |  |

However, managing heterogeneous and intermittent resources to support machine/deep learning (ML/DL) based workflows poses challenges in resource governance for reliability, and confidentiality for model/data privacy protection. There is a need for approaches to handle the volatility of volunteer edge node availability, and also to scale the confidential data-intensive workflow execution across a large number of VEC nodes. In this paper, we present VECA, a reliable and confidential VEC resource clustering solution featuring three-fold methods tailored for executing ML/DL-based scientific workflows on VEC resources. Firstly, a capacity-based clustering approach enhances system reliability and minimizes VEC node search latency. Secondly, a novel two-phase, globally distributed scheduling scheme optimizes job allocation based on node attributes and using time-series-based Recurrent Neural Networks. Lastly, the integration of confidential computing ensures privacy preservation of the scientific workflows, where model and data information are not shared with VEC resources providers. We evaluate VECA in a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) cloud testbed that features OpenFaaS and MicroK8S to support two ML/DL-based scientific workflows viz., G2P-Deep (bioinformatics) and PAS-ML (health informatics). Results from tested experiments demonstrate that our proposed VECA approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods; especially VECA exhibits a two-fold reduction in VEC node search latency and over 20% improvement in productivity rates following execution failures compared to the next best method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted - IC2E 2024 Conference</p></details> |

This paper proposes a system enabling both, contact tracing and data privacy. We propose the use of the Intel SGX trusted execution environment to build a privacy-preserving contact tracing backend. While the concept of a confidential computing backend proposed in this paper can be combined with any existing contact tracing smartphone application, we describe a full contact tracing system for demonstration purposes. A prototype of a privacy-preserving contact tracing system based on SGX has been implemented by the authors in a hackathon.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Confidential Computing Transparency Framework for a Comprehensive Trust Chain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03720v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential Computing enhances privacy of data in-use through hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) that use attestation to verify their integrity, authenticity, and certain runtime properties, along with those of the binaries they execute. However, TEEs require user trust, as attestation alone cannot guarantee the absence of vulnerabilities or backdoors. Enhanced transparency can mitigate the reliance on naive trust. Some organisations currently employ various transparency measures, including open-source firmware, publishing technical documentation, or undergoing external audits, but these require investments with unclear returns. This may discourage the adoption of transparency, leaving users with limited visibility into system privacy measures. Additionally, the lack of standardisation complicates meaningful comparisons between implementations. To address these challenges, we propose a three-level conceptual framework providing organisations with a practical pathway to incrementally improve Confidential Computing transparency. To evaluate whether our transparency framework contributes to an increase in end-user trust, we conducted an empirical study with over 800 non-expert participants. The results indicate that greater transparency improves user comfort, with participants willing to share various types of personal data across different levels of transparency. The study also reveals misconceptions about transparency, highlighting the need for clear communication and user education.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distilled Large Language Model in Confidential Computing Environment for System-on-Chip Design](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16226v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in circuit design tasks and have typically undergone multiple rounds of training. Both the trained models and their associated training data are considered confidential intellectual property (IP) and must be protected from exposure. Confidential Computing offers a promising solution to protect data and models through Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). However, existing TEE implementations are not designed to support the resource-intensive nature of LLMs efficiently. In this work, we first present a comprehensive evaluation of the LLMs within a TEE-enabled confidential computing environment, specifically utilizing Intel Trust Domain Extensions (TDX). We constructed experiments on three environments: TEE-based, CPU-only, and CPU-GPU hybrid implementations, and evaluated their performance in terms of tokens per second. Our first observation is that distilled models, i.e., DeepSeek, surpass other models in performance due to their smaller parameters, making them suitable for resource-constrained devices. Also, in the quantized models such as 4-bit quantization (Q4) and 8-bit quantization (Q8), we observed a performance gain of up to 3x compared to FP16 models. Our findings indicate that for fewer parameter sets, such as DeepSeek-r1-1.5B, the TDX implementation outperforms the CPU version in executing computations within a secure environment. We further validate the results using a testbench designed for SoC design tasks. These validations demonstrate the potential of efficiently deploying lightweight LLMs on resource-constrained systems for semiconductor CAD applications.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures; |
| **[A Lightweight, Anonymous and Confidential Genomic Computing for Industrial Scale Deployment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.01390v1)** | 2021-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies anonymous and confidential genomic case and control computing within the federated framework leveraging SPDZ. Our contribution mainly comprises the following three-fold: \begin{itemize} \item In the first fold, an efficient construction of Beaver triple generators (BTGs) formalized in the 3-party computation leveraging multiplicatively homomorphic key management protocols (mHKMs) is presented and analysed. Interestingly, we are able to show the equivalence between BTGs and mHKMs. We then propose a lightweight construction of BTGs, and show that our construction is secure against semi-honest adversary if the underlying multiplicatively homomorphic encryption is semantically secure. \item In the second fold, a decoupling model for SPDZ with explicit separation of BTGs from MPC servers (MPCs) is introduced and formalized, where BTGs aim to generate the Beaver triples while MPCs to process the input data. A new notion, which we call blind triple dispensation protocol, is then introduced for securely dispensing the generated Beaver triples, and constructed from mHKMs. We demonstrate the power of mHKMs by showing that it is a useful notion not only for generating Beaver triples but also for securely dispensing triples as well. \item In the third-fold, a lightweight genomic case and control computing model is proposed, which reaches the anonymity and confidentiality simultaneously. An efficient truncation algorithm leveraging the depicted BTGs above is then proposed by eliminating computational cost heavy PRandBitL() and PRandInt() protocols involved in the state-of-the-art solutions and thus largely benefits us computing residual vectors for industrial scale deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Early Experience with Confidential Computing Architecture for On-Device Model Protection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08508v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying machine learning (ML) models on user devices can improve privacy (by keeping data local) and reduce inference latency. Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are a practical solution for protecting proprietary models, yet existing TEE solutions have architectural constraints that hinder on-device model deployment. Arm Confidential Computing Architecture (CCA), a new Arm extension, addresses several of these limitations and shows promise as a secure platform for on-device ML. In this paper, we evaluate the performance-privacy trade-offs of deploying models within CCA, highlighting its potential to enable confidential and efficient ML applications. Our evaluations show that CCA can achieve an overhead of, at most, 22% in running models of different sizes and applications, including image classification, voice recognition, and chat assistants. This performance overhead comes with privacy benefits; for example, our framework can successfully protect the model against membership inference attack by an 8.3% reduction in the adversary's success rate. To support further research and early adoption, we make our code and methodology publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 8th Workshop on System Software for Trusted Execution (SysTEX 2025)</p></details> |

But in the process, it has created a huge challenge of security, especially in terms of safeguarding sensitive data. Classical security practices, including encryption at rest and during transit, fail to protect data in use and expose it to various possible breaches. In response to this problem , Confidential Computing has been a tool ,seeking to secure data in processing by usage of hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). TEEs, including Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX) and ARM's TrustZone, offers protected contexts within the processor, where data is kept confidential ,intact and secure , even with malicious software or compromised operating systems. In this research, we have explored the architecture and security features of TEEs like Intel SGX and ARM TrustZone, and their effectiveness in improving cloud data security. From a thorough literature survey ,we have analyzed the deployment strategies, performance indicators, and practical uses of these TEEs for the same purpose. In addition, we have discussed the issues regarding deployment, possible weaknesses, scalability issues, and integration issues. Our results focuses on the central position of TEEs in strengthening and advancing cloud security infrastructures, pointing towards their ability to create a secure foundation for Confidential Computing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Verifying components of Arm(R) Confidential Computing Architecture with ESBMC](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.04375v1)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realm Management Monitor (RMM) is an essential firmware component within the recent Arm Confidential Computing Architecture (Arm CCA). Previous work applies formal techniques to verify the specification and prototype reference implementation of RMM. However, relying solely on a single verification tool may lead to the oversight of certain bugs or vulnerabilities. This paper discusses the application of ESBMC, a state-of-the-art Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)-based software model checker, to further enhance RRM verification. We demonstrate ESBMC's ability to precisely parse the source code and identify specification failures within a reasonable time frame. Moreover, we propose potential improvements for ESBMC to enhance its efficiency for industry engineers. This work contributes to exploring the capabilities of formal verification techniques in real-world scenarios and suggests avenues for further improvements to better meet industrial verification needs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Making Your Program Oblivious: a Comparative Study for Side-channel-safe Confidential Computing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.06442v1)** | 2023-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are gradually adopted by major cloud providers, offering a practical option of \emph{confidential computing} for users who don't fully trust public clouds. TEEs use CPU-enabled hardware features to eliminate direct breaches from compromised operating systems or hypervisors. However, recent studies have shown that side-channel attacks are still effective on TEEs. An appealing solution is to convert applications to be \emph{data oblivious} to deter many side-channel attacks. While a few research prototypes on TEEs have adopted specific data oblivious operations, the general conversion approaches have never been thoroughly compared against and tested on benchmark TEE applications. These limitations make it difficult for researchers and practitioners to choose and adopt a suitable data oblivious approach for their applications. To address these issues, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of several representative conversion approaches and implement benchmark TEE applications with them. We also perform an extensive empirical study to provide insights into their performance and ease of use.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ascend-CC: Confidential Computing on Heterogeneous NPU for Emerging Generative AI Workloads](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11888v1)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud workloads have dominated generative AI based on large language models (LLM). Specialized hardware accelerators, such as GPUs, NPUs, and TPUs, play a key role in AI adoption due to their superior performance over general-purpose CPUs. The AI models and the data are often highly sensitive and come from mutually distrusting parties. Existing CPU-based TEEs such as Intel SGX or AMD SEV do not provide sufficient protection. Device-centric TEEs like Nvidia-CC only address tightly coupled CPU-GPU systems with a proprietary solution requiring TEE on the host CPU side. On the other hand, existing academic proposals are tailored toward specific CPU-TEE platforms. To address this gap, we propose Ascend-CC, a confidential computing architecture based on discrete NPU devices that requires no trust in the host system. Ascend-CC provides strong security by ensuring data and model encryption that protects not only the data but also the model parameters and operator binaries. Ascend-CC uses delegation-based memory semantics to ensure isolation from the host software stack, and task attestation provides strong model integrity guarantees. Our Ascend-CC implementation and evaluation with state-of-the-art LLMs such as Llama2 and Llama3 shows that Ascend-CC introduces minimal overhead with no changes in the AI software stack.</p></details> |  |

We explore different traffic patterns and scheduling strategies using a single Virtual Machine with one NVIDIA H100 GPU, to perform relaxed batch inferences on multiple Large Language Models (LLMs), operating under the constraint of swapping models in and out of memory, which necessitates efficient control. The experiments simulate diverse real-world scenarios by varying parameters such as traffic load, traffic distribution patterns, scheduling strategies, and Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements. The findings provide insights into the differences between confidential and non-confidential settings when performing inference in scenarios requiring active model swapping. Results indicate that in No-CC mode, relaxed batch inference with model swapping latency is 20-30% lower than in confidential mode. Additionally, SLA attainment is 15-20% higher in No-CC settings. Throughput in No-CC scenarios surpasses that of confidential mode by 45-70%, and GPU utilization is approximately 50% higher in No-CC environments. Overall, performance in the confidential setting is inferior to that in the No-CC scenario, primarily due to the additional encryption and decryption overhead required for loading models onto the GPU in confidential environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 tables.

| **[SoK: A cloudy view on trust relationships of CVMs -- How Confidential Virtual Machines are falling short in Public Cloud](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08256v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential computing in the public cloud intends to safeguard workload privacy while outsourcing infrastructure management to a cloud provider. This is achieved by executing customer workloads within so called Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), such as Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs), which protect them from unauthorized access by cloud administrators and privileged system software. At the core of confidential computing lies remote attestation -- a mechanism that enables workload owners to verify the initial state of their workload and furthermore authenticate the underlying hardware. hile this represents a significant advancement in cloud security, this SoK critically examines the confidential computing offerings of market-leading cloud providers to assess whether they genuinely adhere to its core principles. We develop a taxonomy based on carefully selected criteria to systematically evaluate these offerings, enabling us to analyse the components responsible for remote attestation, the evidence provided at each stage, the extent of cloud provider influence and whether this undermines the threat model of confidential computing. Specifically, we investigate how CVMs are deployed in the public cloud infrastructures, the extent to which customers can request and verify attestation evidence, and their ability to define and enforce configuration and attestation requirements. This analysis provides insight into whether confidential computing guarantees -- namely confidentiality and integrity -- are genuinely upheld. Our findings reveal that all major cloud providers retain control over critical parts of the trusted software stack and, in some cases, intervene in the standard remote attestation process. This directly contradicts their claims of delivering confidential computing, as the model fundamentally excludes the cloud provider from the set of trusted entities.</p></details> |  |
| **[CRISP: Confidentiality, Rollback, and Integrity Storage Protection for Confidential Cloud-Native Computing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06822v2)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trusted execution environments (TEEs) protect the integrity and confidentiality of running code and its associated data. Nevertheless, TEEs' integrity protection does not extend to the state saved on disk. Furthermore, modern cloud-native applications heavily rely on orchestration (e.g., through systems such as Kubernetes) and, thus, have their services frequently restarted. During restarts, attackers can revert the state of confidential services to a previous version that may aid their malicious intent. This paper presents CRISP, a rollback protection mechanism that uses an existing runtime for Intel SGX and transparently prevents rollback. Our approach can constrain the attack window to a fixed and short period or give developers the tools to avoid the vulnerability window altogether. Finally, experiments show that applying CRISP in a critical stateful cloud-native application may incur a resource increase but only a minor performance penalty.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enabling Performant and Secure EDA as a Service in Public Clouds Using Confidential Containers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06040v1)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Increasingly, business opportunities available to fabless design teams in the semiconductor industry far exceed those addressable with on-prem compute resources. An attractive option to capture these electronic design automation (EDA) design opportunities is through public cloud bursting. However, security concerns with public cloud bursting arise from having to protect process design kits, third party intellectual property, and new design data for semiconductor devices and chips. One way to address security concerns for public cloud bursting is to leverage confidential containers for EDA workloads. Confidential containers add zero trust computing elements to significantly reduce the probability of intellectual property escapes. A key concern that often follows security discussions is whether EDA workload performance will suffer with confidential computing. In this work we demonstrate a full set of EDA confidential containers and their deployment and characterize performance impacts of confidential elements of the flow including storage and networking. A complete end-to-end confidential container-based EDA workload exhibits 7.13% and 2.05% performance overheads over bare-metal container and VM based solutions, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Private delegated computations using strong isolation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03322v1)** | 2022-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sensitive computations are now routinely delegated to third-parties. In response, Confidential Computing technologies are being introduced to microprocessors, offering a protected processing environment, which we generically call an isolate, providing confidentiality and integrity guarantees to code and data hosted within -- even in the face of a privileged attacker. Isolates, with an attestation protocol, permit remote third-parties to establish a trusted "beachhead" containing known code and data on an otherwise untrusted machine. Yet, the rise of these technologies introduces many new problems, including: how to ease provisioning of computations safely into isolates; how to develop distributed systems spanning multiple classes of isolate; and what to do about the billions of "legacy" devices without support for Confidential Computing? Tackling the problems above, we introduce Veracruz, a framework that eases the design and implementation of complex privacy-preserving, collaborative, delegated computations among a group of mutually mistrusting principals. Veracruz supports multiple isolation technologies and provides a common programming model and attestation protocol across all of them, smoothing deployment of delegated computations over supported technologies. We demonstrate Veracruz in operation, on private in-cloud object detection on encrypted video streaming from a video camera. In addition to supporting hardware-backed isolates -- like AWS Nitro Enclaves and Arm Confidential Computing Architecture Realms -- Veracruz also provides pragmatic "software isolates" on Armv8-A devices without hardware Confidential Computing capability, using the high-assurance seL4 microkernel and our IceCap framework.</p></details> |  |

An IDA is a method that encodes a file $F$ of size $L=|F|$ into $n$ unrecognizable pieces $F_1$, $F_2$, ..., $F_n$, each of size $L/m$ ($m<n$), so that the original file $F$ can be reconstructed from any $m$ pieces. The core of an IDA is the adopted non-systematic $m$-of-$n$ erasure code. This paper makes a systematic study on the \emph{confidentiality} of an IDA and its connection with the adopted erasure code. Two levels of confidentiality are defined: \emph{weak confidentiality} (in the case where some parts of the original file $F$ can be reconstructed explicitly from fewer than $m$ pieces) and \emph{strong confidentiality} (in the case where nothing of the original file $F$ can be reconstructed explicitly from fewer than $m$ pieces). For an IDA that adopts an arbitrary non-systematic erasure code, its confidentiality may fall into weak confidentiality. To achieve strong confidentiality, this paper explores a sufficient and feasible condition on the adopted erasure code. Then, this paper shows that Rabin's IDA has strong confidentiality. At the same time, this paper presents an effective way to construct an IDA with strong confidentiality from an arbitrary $m$-of-$(m+n)$ erasure code. Then, as an example, this paper constructs an IDA with strong confidentiality from a Reed-Solomon code, the computation complexity of which is comparable to or sometimes even lower than that of Rabin's IDA.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version includes a correction on the example in Section IV</p></details> |
| **[TEEMATE: Fast and Efficient Confidential Container using Shared Enclave](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11423v1)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential container is becoming increasingly popular as it meets both needs for efficient resource management by cloud providers, and data protection by cloud users. Specifically, confidential containers integrate the container and the enclave, aiming to inherit the design-wise advantages of both (i.e., resource management and data protection). However, current confidential containers suffer from large performance overheads caused by i) a larger startup latency due to the enclave creation, and ii) a larger memory footprint due to the non-shareable characteristics of enclave memory. This paper explores a design conundrum of confidential container, examining why the confidential containers impose such large performance overheads. Surprisingly, we found there is a universal misconception that an enclave can only be used by a single (containerized) process that created it. However, an enclave can be shared across multiple processes, because an enclave is merely a set of physical resources while the process is an abstraction constructed by the host kernel. To this end, we introduce TeeMate, a new approach to utilize the enclaves on the host system. Especially, TeeMate designs the primitives to i) share the enclave memory between processes, thus preserving memory abstraction, and ii) assign the threads in enclave between processes, thus preserving thread abstraction. We concretized TeeMate on Intel SGX, and implemented confidential serverless computing and confidential database on top of TeeMate based confidential containers. The evaluation clearly demonstrated the strong practical impact of TeeMate by achieving at least 4.5 times lower latency and 2.8 times lower memory usage compared to the applications built on the conventional confidential containers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Encrypted Data Processing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09821v1)** | 2021-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a comprehensive architecture for confidential computing, which we show to be general purpose and quite efficient. It executes the application as is, without any added burden or discipline requirements from the application developers. Furthermore, it does not require the trust of system software at the computing server and does not impose any added burden on the communication subsystem. The proposed Encrypted Data Processing (EDAP) architecture accomplishes confidentiality, authenticity, and freshness of the key-based cryptographic data protection by adopting data encryption with a multi-level key protection scheme. It guarantees that the user data is visible only in non-privileged mode to a designated program trusted by the data owner on a designated hardware, thus protecting the data from an untrusted hardware, hypervisor, OS, or other users' applications. The cryptographic keys and protocols used for achieving these confidential computing requirements are described in a use case example. Encrypting and decrypting data in an EDAP-enabled processor can lead to performance degradation as it adds cycle time to the overall execution. However, our simulation result shows that the slowdown is only 6% on average across a collection of commercial workloads when the data encryption engine is placed between the L1 and L2 cache. We demonstrate that the EDAP architecture is valuable and practicable in the modern cloud environment for confidential computing. EDAP delivers a zero trust model of computing where the user software does not trust system software and vice versa.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 12 figures, manuscript submitted to ACM Transactions on Privacy and Security</p></details> |
| **[Secure and Confidential Certificates of Online Fairness](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02777v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The black-box service model enables ML service providers to serve clients while keeping their intellectual property and client data confidential. Confidentiality is critical for delivering ML services legally and responsibly, but makes it difficult for outside parties to verify important model properties such as fairness. Existing methods that assess model fairness confidentially lack either (i) reliability because they certify fairness with respect to a static set of data, and therefore fail to guarantee fairness in the presence of distribution shift or service provider malfeasance; and/or (ii) scalability due to the computational overhead of confidentiality-preserving cryptographic primitives. We address these problems by introducing online fairness certificates, which verify that a model is fair with respect to data received by the service provider online during deployment. We then present OATH, a deployably efficient and scalable zero-knowledge proof protocol for confidential online group fairness certification. OATH exploits statistical properties of group fairness via a cut-and-choose style protocol, enabling scalability improvements over baselines.</p></details> |  |

Hereby, the finetuning is conducted offsite, i.e., on the computation infrastructure of a third-party cloud provider. We tackle this problem by proposing ObfuscaTune, a novel, efficient and fully utility-preserving approach that combines a simple yet effective obfuscation technique with an efficient usage of confidential computing (only 5% of the model parameters are placed on TEE). We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of ObfuscaTune by validating it on GPT-2 models with different sizes on four NLP benchmark datasets. Finally, we compare to a naïve version of our approach to highlight the necessity of using random matrices with low condition numbers in our approach to reduce errors induced by the obfuscation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2025 (PPAI Workshop)</p></details> |
| **[Blindfold: Confidential Memory Management by Untrusted Operating System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01059v3)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential Computing (CC) has received increasing attention in recent years as a mechanism to protect user data from untrusted operating systems (OSes). Existing CC solutions hide confidential memory from the OS and/or encrypt it to achieve confidentiality. In doing so, they render OS memory optimization unusable or complicate the trusted computing base (TCB) required for optimization. This paper presents our results toward overcoming these limitations, synthesized in a CC design named Blindfold. Like many other CC solutions, Blindfold relies on a small trusted software component running at a higher privilege level than the kernel, called Guardian. It features three techniques that can enhance existing CC solutions. First, instead of nesting page tables, Guardian mediates how the OS accesses memory and handles exceptions by switching page and interrupt tables. Second, Blindfold employs a lightweight capability system to regulate the kernel semantic access to user memory, unifying case-by-case approaches in previous work. Finally, Blindfold provides carefully designed secure ABI for confidential memory management without encryption. We report an implementation of Blindfold that works on ARMv8-A/Linux. Using Blindfold prototype, we are able to evaluate the cost of enabling confidential memory management by the untrusted Linux kernel. We show Blindfold has a smaller runtime TCB than related systems and enjoys competitive performance. More importantly, we show that the Linux kernel, including all of its memory optimizations except memory compression, can function properly for confidential memory. This requires only about 400 lines of kernel modifications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Secure Multi-Party Computation with a Helper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.07690v5)** | 2017-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A client wishes to outsource computation on confidential data to a network of parties. He does not trust a single party but believes that multiple parties do not collude. To solve this problem, we use the idea of treating one of the parties as a helper. A helper assists computation only. Often using more parties ensures confidentiality despite more corrupted parties. This does not hold for adding a helper. But a helper can in some cases lower the amount of communication asymptotically to the theoretical minimum of one bit per AND gate, improving significantly on schemes without a helper. It can also allow for very efficient computations of certain functions, as we show for the exponential function with public base.</p></details> |  |
| **[On (the Lack of) Code Confidentiality in Trusted Execution Environments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07899v1)** | 2022-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) have been proposed as a solution to protect code confidentiality in scenarios where computation is outsourced to an untrusted operator. We study the resilience of such solutions to side-channel attacks in two commonly deployed scenarios: when a confidential code is a native binary that is shipped and executed within a TEE and when the confidential code is an intermediate representation (IR) executed on top of a runtime within a TEE. We show that executing IR code such as WASM bytecode on a runtime executing in a TEE leaks most IR instructions with high accuracy and therefore reveals the confidential code. Contrary to IR execution, native execution is much less susceptible to leakage and largely resists even the most powerful side-channel attacks. We evaluate native execution leakage in Intel SGX and AMD SEV and experimentally demonstrate end-to-end instruction extraction on Intel SGX, with WASM bytecode as IR executed within WAMR, a hybrid between a JIT compiler and interpreter developed by Intel. Our experiments show that IR code leakage from such systems is practical and therefore question the security claims of several commercial solutions which rely on TEEs+WASM for code confidentiality.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces an interactive protocol adapting the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique for private fine-tuning. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) protects the confidentiality of training data and gradients handled by remote worker nodes performing the bulk of computations involving the base model weights. The data owner orchestrates training, requiring minimal local computing power and memory, thus alleviating the need for expensive client-side GPUs. We demonstrate feasibility by fine-tuning a Llama-3.2-1B model, presenting convergence results using HE-compatible quantization and performance benchmarks for HE computations on GPU hardware. This approach enables applications such as confidential knowledge base question answering, private codebase fine-tuning for AI code assistants, AI agents for drafting emails based on a company's email archive, and adapting models to analyze sensitive legal or healthcare documents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentially Private Verification of Survey-Weighted Estimates](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02519v1)** | 2024-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several official statistics agencies release synthetic data as public use microdata files. In practice, synthetic data do not admit accurate results for every analysis. Thus, it is beneficial for agencies to provide users with feedback on the quality of their analyses of the synthetic data. One approach is to couple synthetic data with a verification server that provides users with measures of the similarity of estimates computed with the synthetic and underlying confidential data. However, such measures leak information about the confidential records, so that agencies may wish to apply disclosure control methods to the released verification measures. We present a verification measure that satisfies differential privacy and can be used when the underlying confidential are collected with a complex survey design. We illustrate the verification measure using repeated sampling simulations where the confidential data are sampled with a probability proportional to size design, and the analyst estimates a population total or mean with the synthetic data. The simulations suggest that the verification measures can provide useful information about the quality of synthetic data inferences.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages including references, 5 figures</p></details> |

As a first step toward this vision, we present Obfuscated Secure Partitioned Decoding (OSPD), a system built on two key innovations. First, Secure Partitioned Decoding (SPD) isolates user prompts within per-user processes residing in a confidential virtual machine (CVM) on the cloud, which are inaccessible for the cloud LLM while allowing it to generate tokens efficiently. Second, Prompt Obfuscation (PO) introduces a novel cryptographic technique that enhances SPD resilience against advanced prompt reconstruction attacks. Together, these innovations ensure OSPD protects both prompt and model confidentiality while maintaining service functionality. OSPD enables practical, privacy-preserving cloud-hosted LLM inference for sensitive applications, such as processing personal data, clinical records, and financial documents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Obfuscation using Encryption](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.03345v1)** | 2016-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Protecting source code against reverse engineering and theft is an important problem. The goal is to carry out computations using confidential algorithms on an untrusted party while ensuring confidentiality of algorithms. This problem has been addressed for Boolean circuits known as `circuit privacy'. Circuits corresponding to real-world programs are impractical. Well-known obfuscation techniques are highly practicable, but provide only limited security, e.g., no piracy protection. In this work, we modify source code yielding programs with adjustable performance and security guarantees ranging from indistinguishability obfuscators to (non-secure) ordinary obfuscation. The idea is to artificially generate `misleading' statements. Their results are combined with the outcome of a confidential statement using encrypted \emph{selector variables}. Thus, an attacker must `guess' the encrypted selector variables to disguise the confidential source code. We evaluated our method using more than ten programmers as well as pattern mining across open source code repositories to gain insights of (micro-)coding patterns that are relevant for generating misleading statements. The evaluation reveals that our approach is effective in that it successfully preserves source code confidentiality.</p></details> |  |

However, ensuring complex computations with low gas fees and confidentiality remains challenging. Recent advances in Confidential Computing -- leveraging hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) -- and Proof-carrying Data -- employing cryptographic Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machines (zkVMs) -- hold promise for secure, privacy-preserving off-chain and layer-2 computations. On the other side, a homogeneous reliance on a single technology, such as TEEs or zkVMs, is impractical for decentralized environments with heterogeneous computational requirements. This paper introduces the Trusted Compute Unit (TCU), a unifying framework that enables composable and interoperable verifiable computations across heterogeneous technologies. Our approach allows decentralized applications (dApps) to flexibly offload complex computations to TCUs, obtaining proof of correctness. These proofs can be anchored on-chain for automated dApp interactions, while ensuring confidentiality of input data, and integrity of output data. We demonstrate how TCUs can support a prominent blockchain use case, such as federated learning. By enabling secure off-chain interactions without incurring on-chain confirmation delays or gas fees, TCUs significantly improve system performance and scalability. Experimental insights and performance evaluations confirm the feasibility and practicality of this unified approach, advancing the state of the art in verifiable off-chain services for the blockchain ecosystem.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in 2025 IEEE International Conference on Blockchain and Cryptocurrency (ICBC'25). 9 pages. 4 figures</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce a novel binary verification service, AGORA, scrupulously designed to overcome the challenge. At the heart of this approach lies a strategic insight: certain tasks can be delegated to untrusted entities, while the corresponding validators are securely housed within the trusted computing base (TCB). AGORA can validate untrusted assertions generated for versatile policies. Through a novel blockchain-based bounty task manager, it also utilizes crowdsourcing to remove trust in theorem provers. These synergistic techniques successfully ameliorate the TCB size burden associated with two procedures: binary analysis and theorem proving. The design of AGORA allows untrusted parties to participate in these complex processes. Moreover, based on running the optimized TCB within trusted execution environments and recording the verification process on a blockchain, the public can audit the correctness of verification results. By implementing verification workflows for software-based fault isolation policy and side-channel mitigation, our evaluation demonstrates the efficacy of AGORA.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in OOPSLA 2025</p></details> |

These technologies provide security, integrity, as well as confidentiality in their respective applications. Cloud computing has also been a popular comprehensive technology for several years. Confidential information is often shared with the cloud infrastructure to give customers access to remote resources, such as computation and storage operations. However, cloud computing also presents substantial security threats, issues, and challenges. Therefore, to overcome these difficulties, we propose integrating Blockchain and SDN in the cloud computing platform. In this research, we introduce the architecture to better secure clouds. Moreover, we leverage a distributed Blockchain approach to convey security, confidentiality, privacy, integrity, adaptability, and scalability in the proposed architecture. BC provides a distributed or decentralized and efficient environment for users. Also, we present an SDN approach to improving the reliability, stability, and load balancing capabilities of the cloud infrastructure. Finally, we provide an experimental evaluation of the performance of our SDN and BC-based implementation using different parameters, also monitoring some attacks in the system and proving its efficacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 Pa...</summary><p>12 Pages 16 Figures 3 Tables</p></details> |

Thus, sensitive data and models are in danger of unauthorized access, misuse, and privacy compromises. A relatively new body of research confidentially trains machine learning models on protected data to address these concerns. In this survey, we summarize notable studies in this emerging area of research. With a unified framework, we highlight the critical challenges and innovations in outsourcing machine learning confidentially. We focus on the cryptographic approaches for confidential machine learning (CML), primarily on model training, while also covering other directions such as perturbation-based approaches and CML in the hardware-assisted computing environment. The discussion will take a holistic way to consider a rich context of the related threat models, security assumptions, design principles, and associated trade-offs amongst data utility, cost, and confidentiality.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Cybersecurity Journal, Springer, 2021</p></details> |

Despite the wide applicability of IFC as a mechanism for guaranteeing confidentiality and integrity -- the fundamental properties on which computer security relies -- existing IFC systems have seen little use, requiring users to reason about complicated mechanisms such as lattices of security labels and dual notions of confidentiality and integrity within these lattices. We propose a system that diverges significantly from previous work on information flow control, opting to reason directly about the data that programmers already work with. In doing so, we naturally and seamlessly combine the clasically separate notions of confidentiality and integrity into one unified framework, further simplifying reasoning. We motivate and showcase our work through two case studies on TLS private key management: one for Rocket, a popular Rust web framework, and another for Conduit, a server implementation for the Matrix messaging service written in Rust.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

Restricting access to only the privatized data makes it challenging to perform valid statistical inference on parameters underlying the confidential data. Specifically, the likelihood function of the privatized data requires integrating over the large space of confidential databases and is typically intractable. For Bayesian analysis, this results in a posterior distribution that is doubly intractable, rendering traditional MCMC techniques inapplicable. We propose an MCMC framework to perform Bayesian inference from the privatized data, which is applicable to a wide range of statistical models and privacy mechanisms. Our MCMC algorithm augments the model parameters with the unobserved confidential data, and alternately updates each one conditional on the other. For the potentially challenging step of updating the confidential data, we propose a generic approach that exploits the privacy guarantee of the mechanism to ensure efficiency. We give results on the computational complexity, acceptance rate, and mixing properties of our MCMC. We illustrate the efficacy and applicability of our methods on a naïve-Bayes log-linear model as well as on a linear regression model.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables.

Motivated by the pervasive reliance on single service providers for data storage and computation, we propose a privacy-preserving scheme that achieves information-theoretic security guarantees for computing polynomials over non-uniform data distributions. Our framework builds upon the concept of perfect subset privacy and employs linear hashing techniques to transform non-uniform data into approximately uniform distributions, enabling robust and secure computation. We derive leakage bounds and demonstrate that information leakage of any subset of user data to untrusted service providers, i.e., not only to colluding workers but also (and more importantly) to the admin, remains negligible under the proposed scheme.</p></details> | <details><summary>Parts...</summary><p>Parts of this work were submitted to ISIT 2025</p></details> |

We benchmark the overhead introduced by TEE mode across various LLMs and token lengths, with a particular focus on the bottleneck caused by CPU-GPU data transfers via PCIe. Our results indicate that while there is minimal computational overhead within the GPU, the overall performance penalty is primarily attributable to data transfer. For the majority of typical LLM queries, the overhead remains below 7%, with larger models and longer sequences experiencing nearly zero overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Careful Whisper: Attestation for peer-to-peer Confidential Computing networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.14796v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are designed to protect the privacy and integrity of data in use. They enable secure data processing and sharing in peer-to-peer networks, such as vehicular ad hoc networks of autonomous vehicles, without compromising confidentiality. In these networks, nodes must establish mutual trust to collaborate securely. TEEs can achieve this through remote attestation, where a prover presents evidence of its trustworthiness to a verifier, which then decides whether or not to trust the prover. However, a naive peer-to-peer attestation approach, where every TEE directly attests every other TEE, results in quadratic communication overhead. This is inefficient in dynamic environments, where nodes frequently join and leave the network. To address this, we present Careful Whisper, a gossip-based protocol that disseminates trust efficiently, reducing attestation overhead to linear complexity under ideal conditions. It enables interoperability by enabling transitive trust across heterogeneous networks, and supports trust establishment with offline nodes via relayed attestations. Using a custom discrete-event simulator, we show that Careful Whisper propagates trust both faster and more widely than naive approaches across various network topologies. Our results demonstrate that our protocol is resource efficient, sending ~21.5 KiB and requiring 0.158 seconds per round in a 200-node network, and that our protocol is resilient to attestation failures across various network topologies.</p></details> |  |

Social media channels, corporate structures and individual consumers are all switching to the magnificent world of cloud computing. The flip side to this coin is that with cloud storage emerges the security issues of confidentiality, data integrity and data availability. Since the cloud is a mere collection of tangible super computers spread across the world, authentication and authorization for data access is more than a necessity. Our work attempts to overcome these security threats. The proposed methodology suggests the encryption of the files to be uploaded on the cloud. The integrity and confidentiality of the data uploaded by the user is ensured doubly by not only encrypting it but also providing access to the data only on successful authentication.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

The rise of cloud computing and the growing demand for multiparty applications however means that building modern CIA systems is more challenging than ever. In response, we present the Confidential Consortium Framework (CCF), a general-purpose foundation for developing secure stateful CIA applications. CCF combines centralized compute with decentralized trust, supporting deployment on untrusted cloud infrastructure and transparent governance by mutually untrusted parties. CCF leverages hardware-based trusted execution environments for remotely verifiable confidentiality and code integrity. This is coupled with state machine replication backed by an auditable immutable ledger for data integrity and high availability. CCF enables each service to bring its own application logic, custom multiparty governance model, and deployment scenario, decoupling the operators of nodes from the consortium that governs them.

Homomorphic encryption (HE) offers a solution by enabling computations on encrypted data without decryption, allowing secure outsourcing while maintaining data confidentiality. However, HE faces performance challenges in query-intensive databases. To address this, we propose two novel optimizations, Silca and SilcaZ, tailored to outsourced databases in cloud computing. Silca utilizes a singular caching technique to reduce computational overhead, while SilcaZ leverages modular arithmetic operations to ensure the applicability of singular caching for intensive HE operations. We prove the semantic security of Silca and SilcaZ and implement them with CKKS and BGV in HElib as MySQL loadable functions. Extensive experiments with seven real-world datasets demonstrate their superior performance compared to existing HE schemes, bridging the gap between theoretical advancements and practical applications in applying HE schemes on outsourced databases in cloud computing.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP)-based approach for the verifiable execution of business processes while preserving confidentiality. We integrate ZK virtual machines (zkVMs) into business process management engines through a comprehensive system architecture and a prototypical implementation. Our approach supports chained verifiable computations through proof compositions. On the example of product carbon footprinting, we model sequential footprinting activities and demonstrate how organizations can prove and verify the integrity of verifiable processes without exposing sensitive information. We assess different ZKP proving variants within process models for their efficiency in proving and verifying, and discuss the practical integration of ZKPs throughout the Business Process Management (BPM) lifecycle. Our experiment-driven evaluation demonstrates the automation of process verification under given confidentiality constraints.</p></details> |  |

This paradigm tackles the vulnerability of the centralized malicious server in vanilla FL and inherits the trustfulness and robustness offered by blockchain. However, existing blockchain-enabled schemes face challenges related to inadequate confidentiality on models and limited computational resources of blockchains to perform large-scale FL computations. In this paper, we present Voltran, an innovative hybrid platform designed to achieve trust, confidentiality, and robustness for FL based on the combination of the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and blockchain technology. We offload the FL aggregation computation into TEE to provide an isolated, trusted and customizable off-chain execution, and then guarantee the authenticity and verifiability of aggregation results on the blockchain. Moreover, we provide strong scalability on multiple FL scenarios by introducing a multi-SGX parallel execution strategy to amortize the large-scale FL workload. We implement a prototype of Voltran and conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Voltran incurs minimal additional overhead while guaranteeing trust, confidentiality, and authenticity, and it significantly brings a significant speed-up compared to state-of-the-art ciphertext aggregation schemes.</p></details> |  |

Next, a dirty-paper secure coding scheme and its simplified version are described. For each case, the corresponding achievable rate region is derived under the perfect secrecy requirement.

The current state of the art is to use property-preserving encrypting techniques (e.g., deterministic encryption) to protect the confidentiality of the data and support query processing at the same time. Unfortunately, these techniques have many limitations. Recently, trusted computing platforms (e.g., Intel SGX) have emerged as an alternative to implement encrypted databases. This paper demonstrates some vulnerabilities and the limitations of this technology, but it also shows how to make best use of it in order to improve on confidentiality, functionality, and performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[A New Approach to Privacy-Preserving Clinical Decision Support Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.01107v2)** | 2018-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) are a category of health information technologies that can assist clinicians to choose optimal treatments. These support systems are based on clinical trials and expert knowledge; however, the amount of data available to these systems is limited. For this reason, CDSSs could be significantly improved by using the knowledge obtained by treating patients. This knowledge is mainly contained in patient records, whose usage is restricted due to privacy and confidentiality constraints. Methods: A treatment effectiveness measure, containing valuable information for treatment prescription, was defined and a method to extract this measure from patient records was developed. This method uses an advanced cryptographic technology, known as secure Multiparty Computation (henceforth referred to as MPC), to preserve the privacy of the patient records and the confidentiality of the clinicians' decisions. Results: Our solution enables to compute the effectiveness measure of a treatment based on patient records, while preserving privacy. Moreover, clinicians are not burdened with the computational and communication costs introduced by the privacy-preserving techniques that are used. Our system is able to compute the effectiveness of 100 treatments for a specific patient in less than 24 minutes, querying a database containing 20,000 patient records. Conclusion: This paper presents a novel and efficient clinical decision support system, that harnesses the potential and insights acquired from treatment data, while preserving the privacy of patient records and the confidentiality of clinician decisions.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |

However, the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks underscores the need for security measures that go beyond conventional IT protections and address the unique vulnerabilities of CPSs. This study proposes a confidential data-driven gain-tuning framework using homomorphic encryption, such as ElGamal and CKKS encryption schemes, to enhance cybersecurity in gain-tuning processes outsourced to external servers. The idea for realizing confidential FRIT is to replace the matrix inversion operation with a vector summation form, allowing homomorphic operations to be applied. Numerical examples under 128-bit security confirm performance comparable to conventional methods while providing guidelines for selecting suitable encryption schemes for secure CPS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synergia: Hardening High-Assurance Security Systems with Confidential and Trusted Computing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.06091v1)** | 2022-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-assurance security systems require strong isolation from the untrusted world to protect the security-sensitive or privacy-sensitive data they process. Existing regulations impose that such systems must execute in a trustworthy operating system (OS) to ensure they are not collocated with untrusted software that might negatively impact their availability or security. However, the existing techniques to attest to the OS integrity fall short due to the cuckoo attack. In this paper, we first show a novel defense mechanism against the cuckoo attack, and we formally prove it. Then, we implement it as part of an integrity monitoring and enforcement framework that attests to the trustworthiness of the OS from 3.7x to 8.5x faster than the existing integrity monitoring systems. We demonstrate its practicality by protecting the execution of a real-world eHealth application, performing micro and macro-benchmarks, and assessing the security risk.</p></details> |  |
| **[Confidential Inference via Ternary Model Partitioning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.00969v3)** | 2020-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Today's cloud vendors are competing to provide various offerings to simplify and accelerate AI service deployment. However, cloud users always have concerns about the confidentiality of their runtime data, which are supposed to be processed on third-party's compute infrastructures. Information disclosure of user-supplied data may jeopardize users' privacy and breach increasingly stringent data protection regulations. In this paper, we systematically investigate the life cycles of inference inputs in deep learning image classification pipelines and understand how the information could be leaked. Based on the discovered insights, we develop a Ternary Model Partitioning mechanism and bring trusted execution environments to mitigate the identified information leakages. Our research prototype consists of two co-operative components: (1) Model Assessment Framework, a local model evaluation and partitioning tool that assists cloud users in deployment preparation; (2) Infenclave, an enclave-based model serving system for online confidential inference in the cloud. We have conducted comprehensive security and performance evaluation on three representative ImageNet-level deep learning models with different network depths and architectural complexity. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of launching confidential inference services in the cloud with maximized confidentiality guarantees and low performance costs.</p></details> |  |

CAIN model suggest maintaining the Confidentiality, Authenticity, Integrity and Non-repudiation (CAIN) of information. Oracle 8i, 9i and 11g Databases support SQLJ framework allowing embedding of SQL statements in Java Programs and providing programmer friendly means to access the Oracle database. As cloud computing technology is becoming popular, SQLJ is considered as a flexible and user friendly language for developing distributed applications in grid architectures. SQLJ source codes are translated to java byte codes and decompilation is generation of source codes from intermediate byte codes. The intermediate SQLJ application byte codes are open to decompilation, allowing a malicious reader to forcefully decompile it for understanding confidential business logic or data from the codes. To the best of our knowledge, strong and cost effective techniques exist for Oracle Database security, but still data security techniques are lacking for client side applications, giving possibility for revelation of confidential business data. Data obfuscation is hiding the data in codes and we suggest enhancing the data security in SQLJ source codes by data hiding, to mitigate disclosure of confidential business data, especially integers in distributed applications.</p></details> | 4 pages,3 Figures |

This paper illustrates how interference can be used to counter eavesdropping and assist secrecy. In particular, a wire-tap channel with a helping interferer (WT-HI) is considered. Here, a transmitter sends a confidential message to its intended receiver in the presence of a passive eavesdropper and with the help of an independent interferer. The interferer, which does not know the confidential message, helps in ensuring the secrecy of the message by sending an independent signal. An achievable secrecy rate and several computable outer bounds on the secrecy capacity of the WT-HI are given for both discrete memoryless and Gaussian channels.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</p></details> |

Protecting data providers' privacy desires a function for secretly shuffling the data collection. We present the first efficient secure multi-party computation protocol for secret shuffling in scenarios with a central server. Based on a novel approach to random index distribution, our solution enables the randomization of the order of a sequence of encrypted data such that no observer can map between elements of the original sequence and the shuffled sequence with probability better than guessing. It allows for shuffling data encrypted under an additively homomorphic cryptosystem with constant round complexity and linear computational complexity. Being a general-purpose protocol, it is of relevance for a variety of practical use cases.</p></details> |  |

We propose an aggregation algorithm, which supports a large spectrum of potential applications including complex voting protocols. It relies on the distributed hash table Kademlia, used in BitTorrent, for pseudonymous communication between randomly predetermined peers to ensure a high degree of confidentiality which does not solely relies on cryptography. The distribution of data and computation limits the potential for data breaches, and reduces the need for institutional trust. Experimental results confirm the complexity of O(n) for n peers allowing for large-scale applications.</p></details> |  |

To ensure the security of confidential image data, image encryption using visual cryptography plays a crucial role. To share multiple images using visual cryptography, the company organizer utilizes the concept of a universal or common share. Likewise, quantum computing is an emerging technology that facilitates secure communication. The ability of quantum computers to solve certain mathematical problems efficiently threatens the security of many current encryption algorithms. Hence, to leverage the strengths of quantum computing and visual cryptography, this research introduces a novel universal share-based quantum multi-secret sharing technique for secure image communication. Quantum computing enables the scheme to exhibit high resilience to different eavesdropping threats. Consequently, the proposed method offers robust security solution for sharing confidential images across a range of applications, including enterprise data access and military communications.</p></details> |  |

The combination of CPU and GPU is particularly popular due to its versatility. However, these heterogeneous systems face significant security and privacy risks. Advances in privacy-preserving techniques, especially hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), offer effective protection for GPU applications. Nonetheless, the potential security risks involved in extending TEEs to GPUs in heterogeneous systems remain uncertain and need further investigation. To investigate these risks in depth, we study the existing popular GPU TEE designs and summarize and compare their key implications. Additionally, we review existing powerful attacks on GPUs and traditional TEEs deployed on CPUs, along with the efforts to mitigate these threats. We identify potential attack surfaces introduced by GPU TEEs and provide insights into key considerations for designing secure GPU TEEs. This survey is timely as new TEEs for heterogeneous systems, particularly GPUs, are being developed, highlighting the need to understand potential security threats and build both efficient and secure systems.</p></details> | 35 pages, 7 figures |

Therefore, limiting information flow using robust security policies becomes increasingly vital. We focus on the non-interference policy, where the goal is to ensure that confidential data can not impact public data. This paper presents a type system, for a subset of the ReScript syntax, designed to enforce non-interference. We conclude with a proof of soundness for the type system, demonstrating that if an expression is type-able, it is inherently non-interferent. In addition, we provide a brief overview of a type checker that implements the previously mentioned type system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Benja...</summary><p>Benjamin Bennetzen: 0009-0007-1751-6862 Daniel Vang Kleist: 0009-0005-1785-2124 Emilie Sonne Steinmann: 0009-0000-4733-5842 Loke Walsted: 0009-0002-1758-4594 Nikolaj Rossander Kristensen: 0009-0005-2339-8247 Peter Buus Steffensen: 0009-0005-6410-5869</p></details> |
| **[Sharing without Showing: Secure Cloud Analytics with Trusted Execution Environments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10574v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many applications benefit from computations over the data of multiple users while preserving confidentiality. We present a solution where multiple mutually distrusting users' data can be aggregated with an acceptable overhead, while allowing users to be added to the system at any time without re-encrypting data. Our solution to this problem is to use a Trusted Execution Environment (Intel SGX) for the computation, while the confidential data is encrypted with the data owner's key and can be stored anywhere, without trust in the service provider. We do not require the user to be online during the computation phase and do not require a trusted party to store data in plain text. Still, the computation can only be carried out if the data owner explicitly has given permission. Experiments using common functions such as the sum, least square fit, histogram, and SVM classification, exhibit an average overhead of $1.6 \times$. In addition to these performance experiments, we present a use case for computing the distributions of taxis in a city without revealing the position of any other taxi to the other parties.</p></details> |  |
| **[Verifiable Privacy-Preserving Computing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.08248v3)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Privacy-preserving computation (PPC) methods, such as secure multiparty computation (MPC) and homomorphic encryption (HE), are deployed increasingly often to guarantee data confidentiality in computations over private, distributed data. Similarly, we observe a steep increase in the adoption of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to guarantee (public) verifiability of locally executed computations. We project that applications that are data intensive and require strong privacy guarantees, are also likely to require verifiable correctness guarantees, especially when outsourced. While the combination of methods for verifiability and privacy protection has clear benefits, certain challenges stand before their widespread practical adoption. In this work, we analyze existing solutions that combine verifiability with privacy-preserving computations over distributed data, in order to preserve confidentiality and guarantee correctness at the same time. We classify and compare 37 different schemes, regarding solution approach, security, efficiency, and practicality. Lastly, we discuss some of the most promising solutions in this regard, and present various open challenges and directions for future research.</p></details> | 22 pages, 4 tables |
| **[Reaching Data Confidentiality and Model Accountability on the CalTrain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.03230v1)** | 2018-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed collaborative learning (DCL) paradigms enable building joint machine learning models from distrusting multi-party participants. Data confidentiality is guaranteed by retaining private training data on each participant's local infrastructure. However, this approach to achieving data confidentiality makes today's DCL designs fundamentally vulnerable to data poisoning and backdoor attacks. It also limits DCL's model accountability, which is key to backtracking the responsible "bad" training data instances/contributors. In this paper, we introduce CALTRAIN, a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) based centralized multi-party collaborative learning system that simultaneously achieves data confidentiality and model accountability. CALTRAIN enforces isolated computation on centrally aggregated training data to guarantee data confidentiality. To support building accountable learning models, we securely maintain the links between training instances and their corresponding contributors. Our evaluation shows that the models generated from CALTRAIN can achieve the same prediction accuracy when compared to the models trained in non-protected environments. We also demonstrate that when malicious training participants tend to implant backdoors during model training, CALTRAIN can accurately and precisely discover the poisoned and mislabeled training data that lead to the runtime mispredictions.</p></details> |  |

In comparison with perfect secret sharing it achieves a significantly smaller memory overhead and better performance, but provides only incremental confidentiality. Therefore, even if it is not possible to explicitly reconstruct data from less than the required amount of fragments, it is still possible to deduce some information about the nature of data by looking at preserved data patterns inside a fragment. The idea behind this paper is to provide a lightweight data fragmentation scheme, that would combine the space efficiency and simplicity that could be find in Information Dispersal Algorithms with a computational level of data confidentiality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Walnut: A low-trust trigger-action platform](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.12447v1)** | 2020-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trigger-action platforms are a new type of system that connect IoT devices with web services. For example, the popular IFTTT platform can connect Fitbit with Google Calendar to add a bedtime reminder based on sleep history. However, these platforms present confidentiality and integrity risks as they run on public cloud infrastructure and compute over sensitive user data. This paper describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of Walnut, a low-trust trigger-action platform that mimics the functionality of IFTTT, while ensuring confidentiality of data and correctness of computation, at a low resource cost. The key enabler for Walnut is a new two-party secure computation protocol that (i) efficiently performs strings substitutions, which is a common computation in trigger-action platform workloads, and (ii) replicates computation over heterogeneous trusted-hardware machines from different vendors to ensure correctness of computation output as long as one of the machines is not compromised. An evaluation of Walnut demonstrates its plausible deployability and low overhead relative to a non-secure baseline--3.6x in CPU and 4.3x in network for all but a small percentage of programs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Performance Analysis of Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks and Centralized Clouds](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08306v1)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) represents a shift in the digital infrastructure of today's Internet. While Centralized Service Providers (CSP) monopolize cloud computing, DePINs aim to enhance data sovereignty and confidentiality and increase resilience against a single point of failure. Due to the novelty of the emerging field of DePIN, this work focuses on the potential of DePINs to disrupt traditional centralized architectures by taking advantage of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and crypto-economic design in combination with blockchains. This combination yields Acurast, a more distributed, resilient, and user-centric physical infrastructure deployment. Through comparative analysis with centralized systems, particularly in serverless computing contexts, this work seeks to lay the first steps in scientifically evaluating DePINs and quantitatively comparing them in terms of efficiency and effectiveness in real-world applications. The findings suggest DePINs' potential to (i) reduce trust assumptions and physically decentralized infrastructure, (ii) increase efficiency and performance simultaneously while improving the computation's (iii) confidentiality and verifiability.</p></details> |  |
| **[A performance analysis of VM-based Trusted Execution Environments for Confidential Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11558v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning approach that has emerged as an effective way to address recent privacy concerns. However, FL introduces the need for additional security measures as FL alone is still subject to vulnerabilities such as model and data poisoning and inference attacks. Confidential Computing (CC) is a paradigm that, by leveraging hardware-based trusted execution environments (TEEs), protects the confidentiality and integrity of ML models and data, thus resulting in a powerful ally of FL applications. Typical TEEs offer an application-isolation level but suffer many drawbacks, such as limited available memory and debugging and coding difficulties. The new generation of TEEs offers a virtual machine (VM)-based isolation level, thus reducing the porting effort for existing applications. In this work, we compare the performance of VM-based and application-isolation level TEEs for confidential FL (CFL) applications. In particular, we evaluate the impact of TEEs and additional security mechanisms such as TLS (for securing the communication channel). The results, obtained across three datasets and two deep learning models, demonstrate that the new VM-based TEEs introduce a limited overhead (at most 1.5x), thus paving the way to leverage public and untrusted computing environments, such as HPC facilities or public cloud, without detriment to performance.</p></details> |  |

Despite massive efforts in designing hardware enhancements for data and code protection, existing solutions incur significant performance overhead as the encryption/decryption is on the critical path. In this paper, we present Sealer, a high-performance and low-overhead in-SRAM memory encryption engine by exploiting the massive parallelism and bitline computational capability of SRAM subarrays. Sealer encrypts data before sending it off-chip and decrypts it upon receiving the memory blocks, thus, providing data confidentiality. Our proposed solution requires only minimal modifications to the existing SRAM peripheral circuitry. Sealer can achieve up to two orders of magnitude throughput-per-area improvement while consuming 3x less energy compared to the prior solutions.</p></details> | 6 pages, ISLPED 2022 |
| **[Secure Multiparty Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19120v1)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As usage of generative AI tools skyrockets, the amount of sensitive information being exposed to these models and centralized model providers is alarming. For example, confidential source code from Samsung suffered a data leak as the text prompt to ChatGPT encountered data leakage. An increasing number of companies are restricting the use of LLMs (Apple, Verizon, JPMorgan Chase, etc.) due to data leakage or confidentiality issues. Also, an increasing number of centralized generative model providers are restricting, filtering, aligning, or censoring what can be used. Midjourney and RunwayML, two of the major image generation platforms, restrict the prompts to their system via prompt filtering. Certain political figures are restricted from image generation, as well as words associated with women's health care, rights, and abortion. In our research, we present a secure and private methodology for generative artificial intelligence that does not expose sensitive data or models to third-party AI providers. Our work modifies the key building block of modern generative AI algorithms, e.g. the transformer, and introduces confidential and verifiable multiparty computations in a decentralized network to maintain the 1) privacy of the user input and obfuscation to the output of the model, and 2) introduce privacy to the model itself. Additionally, the sharding process reduces the computational burden on any one node, enabling the distribution of resources of large generative AI processes across multiple, smaller nodes. We show that as long as there exists one honest node in the decentralized computation, security is maintained. We also show that the inference process will still succeed if only a majority of the nodes in the computation are successful. Thus, our method offers both secure and verifiable computation in a decentralized network.</p></details> |  |
| **[Confidential LLM Inference: Performance and Cost Across CPU and GPU TEEs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18886v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed on converged Cloud and High-Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructure. However, as LLMs handle confidential inputs and are fine-tuned on costly, proprietary datasets, their heightened security requirements slow adoption in privacy-sensitive sectors such as healthcare and finance. We investigate methods to address this gap and propose Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) as a solution for securing end-to-end LLM inference. We validate their practicality by evaluating these compute-intensive workloads entirely within CPU and GPU TEEs. On the CPU side, we conduct an in-depth study running full Llama2 inference pipelines (7B, 13B, 70B) inside Intel's TDX and SGX, accelerated by Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX). We derive 12 insights, including that across various data types, batch sizes, and input lengths, CPU TEEs impose under 10% throughput and 20% latency overheads, further reduced by AMX. We run LLM inference on NVIDIA H100 Confidential Compute GPUs, contextualizing our CPU findings and observing throughput penalties of 4-8% that diminish as batch and input sizes grow. By comparing performance, cost, and security trade-offs, we show how CPU TEEs can be more cost-effective or secure than their GPU counterparts. To our knowledge, our work is the first to comprehensively demonstrate the performance and practicality of modern TEEs across both CPUs and GPUs for enabling confidential LLMs (cLLMs).</p></details> |  |
| **[Proteus: Preserving Model Confidentiality during Graph Optimizations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12512v1)** | 2024-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) models have revolutionized numerous domains, yet optimizing them for computational efficiency remains a challenging endeavor. Development of new DL models typically involves two parties: the model developers and performance optimizers. The collaboration between the parties often necessitates the model developers exposing the model architecture and computational graph to the optimizers. However, this exposure is undesirable since the model architecture is an important intellectual property, and its innovations require significant investments and expertise. During the exchange, the model is also vulnerable to adversarial attacks via model stealing. This paper presents Proteus, a novel mechanism that enables model optimization by an independent party while preserving the confidentiality of the model architecture. Proteus obfuscates the protected model by partitioning its computational graph into subgraphs and concealing each subgraph within a large pool of generated realistic subgraphs that cannot be easily distinguished from the original. We evaluate Proteus on a range of DNNs, demonstrating its efficacy in preserving confidentiality without compromising performance optimization opportunities. Proteus effectively hides the model as one alternative among up to $10^{32}$ possible model architectures, and is resilient against attacks with a learning-based adversary. We also demonstrate that heuristic based and manual approaches are ineffective in identifying the protected model. To our knowledge, Proteus is the first work that tackles the challenge of model confidentiality during performance optimization. Proteus will be open-sourced for direct use and experimentation, with easy integration with compilers such as ONNXRuntime.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trustworthy confidential virtual machines for the masses](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15277v1)** | 2024-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential computing alleviates the concerns of distrustful customers by removing the cloud provider from their trusted computing base and resolves their disincentive to migrate their workloads to the cloud. This is facilitated by new hardware extensions, like AMD's SEV Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP), which can run a whole virtual machine with confidentiality and integrity protection against a potentially malicious hypervisor owned by an untrusted cloud provider. However, the assurance of such protection to either the service providers deploying sensitive workloads or the end-users passing sensitive data to services requires sending proof to the interested parties. Service providers can retrieve such proof by performing remote attestation while end-users have typically no means to acquire this proof or validate its correctness and therefore have to rely on the trustworthiness of the service providers. In this paper, we present Revelio, an approach that features two main contributions: i) it allows confidential virtual machine (VM)-based workloads to be designed and deployed in a way that disallows any tampering even by the service providers and ii) it empowers users to easily validate their integrity. In particular, we focus on web-facing workloads, protect them leveraging SEV-SNP, and enable end-users to remotely attest them seamlessly each time a new web session is established. To highlight the benefits of Revelio, we discuss how a standalone stateful VM that hosts an open-source collaboration office suite can be secured and present a replicated protocol proxy that enables commodity users to securely access the Internet Computer, a decentralized blockchain infrastructure.</p></details> |  |

| **[Making Serverless Computing Extensible: A Case Study of Serverless Data Analytics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11929v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing has attracted a broad range of applications due to its ease of use and resource elasticity. However, developing serverless applications often poses a dilemma -- relying on general-purpose serverless platforms can fall short of delivering satisfactory performance for complex workloads, whereas building application-specific serverless systems undermines the simplicity and generality. In this paper, we propose an extensible design principle for serverless computing. We argue that a platform should enable developers to extend system behaviors for domain-specialized optimizations while retaining a shared, easy-to-use serverless environment. We take data analytics as a representative serverless use case and realize this design principle in Proteus. Proteus introduces a novel abstraction of decision workflows, allowing developers to customize control-plane behaviors for improved application performance. Preliminary results show that Proteus's prototype effectively optimizes analytical query execution and supports fine-grained resource sharing across diverse applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Formal Foundations of Serverless Computing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.05870v6)** | 2021-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing (also known as functions as a service) is a new cloud computing abstraction that makes it easier to write robust, large-scale web services. In serverless computing, programmers write what are called serverless functions, and the cloud platform transparently manages the operating system, resource allocation, load-balancing, and fault tolerance. When demand for the service spikes, the platform automatically allocates additional hardware to the service and manages load-balancing; when demand falls, the platform silently deallocates idle resources; and when the platform detects a failure, it transparently retries affected requests. In 2014, Amazon Web Services introduced the first serverless platform, AWS Lambda, and similar abstractions are now available on all major cloud computing platforms. Unfortunately, the serverless computing abstraction exposes several low-level operational details that make it hard for programmers to write and reason about their code. This paper sheds light on this problem by presenting $λ_Λ$, an operational semantics of the essence of serverless computing. Despite being a small (half a page) core calculus, $λ_Λ$ models all the low-level details that serverless functions can observe. To show that $λ_Λ$ is useful, we present three applications. First, to ease reasoning about code, we present a simplified naive semantics of serverless execution and precisely characterize when the naive semantics and $λ_Λ$ coincide. Second, we augment $λ_Λ$ with a key-value store to allow reasoning about stateful serverless functions. Third, since a handful of serverless platforms support serverless function composition, we show how to extend $λ_Λ$ with a composition language. We have implemented this composition language and show that it outperforms prior work.</p></details> |  |
| **[This is not the End: Rethinking Serverless Function Termination](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.02330v1)** | 2022-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Elastic scaling is one of the central benefits provided by serverless platforms, and requires that they scale resource up and down in response to changing workloads. Serverless platforms scale-down resources by terminating previously launched instances (which are containers or processes). The serverless programming model ensures that terminating instances is safe assuming all application code running on the instance has either completed or timed out. Safety thus depends on the serverless platform's correctly determining that application processing is complete. In this paper, we start with the observation that current serverless platforms do not account for pending asynchronous I/O operations when determining whether application processing is complete. These platforms are thus unsafe when executing programs that use asynchronous I/O, and incorrectly deciding that application processing has terminated can result in data inconsistency when these platforms are used. We show that the reason for this problem is that current serverless semantics couple termination and response generation in serverless applications. We address this problem by proposing an extension to current semantics that decouples response generation and termination, and demonstrate the efficacy and benefits of our proposal by extending OpenWhisk, an open source serverless platform.</p></details> |  |

We will show how it solves the challenges of autoscaling GPU based inference and discuss some of the lessons learnt from using it in production.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 1 figure, presented at workshop on "Challenges in Deploying and Monitoring Machine Learning System" at ICML 2020</p></details> |
| **[Supporting Multi-Cloud in Serverless Computing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.09367v4)** | 2023-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing is a widely adopted cloud execution model composed of Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) and Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) offerings. The increased level of abstraction makes vendor lock-in inherent to serverless computing, raising more concerns than previous cloud paradigms. Multi-cloud serverless is a promising emerging approach against vendor lock-in, yet multiple challenges must be overcome to tap its potential. First, we need to be aware of both the performance and cost of each FaaS provider. Second, a multi-cloud architecture must be proposed before deploying a multi-cloud workflow. Domain-specific serverless offerings must then be integrated into the multi-cloud architecture to improve performance or save costs. Moreover, dealing with serverless offerings from multiple providers is challenging. Finally, we require workload portability support for serverless multi-cloud. In this paper, we present a multi-cloud library for cross-serverless offerings. We develop the End Analysis System (EAS) to support comparison among public FaaS providers in terms of performance and cost. Moreover, we design proof-of-concept multi-cloud architectures with domain-specific serverless offerings to alleviate problems such as data gravity. Finally, we deploy workloads on these architectures to evaluate several public FaaS offerings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the 15th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing Companion (UCC'22 Companion)</p></details> |

The great demand for developing serverless applications poses unique challenges to software developers. However, Software Engineering (SE) has not yet wholeheartedly tackled these challenges. In this paper, we outline a vision for how SE can facilitate the development of serverless applications and call for actions by the SE research community to reify this vision. Specifically, we discuss possible directions in which researchers and cloud providers can facilitate serverless computing from the SE perspective, including configuration management, data security, application migration, performance, testing and debugging, etc.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detection of Compromised Functions in a Serverless Cloud Environment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02641v1)** | 2024-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing is an emerging cloud paradigm with serverless functions at its core. While serverless environments enable software developers to focus on developing applications without the need to actively manage the underlying runtime infrastructure, they open the door to a wide variety of security threats that can be challenging to mitigate with existing methods. Existing security solutions do not apply to all serverless architectures, since they require significant modifications to the serverless infrastructure or rely on third-party services for the collection of more detailed data. In this paper, we present an extendable serverless security threat detection model that leverages cloud providers' native monitoring tools to detect anomalous behavior in serverless applications. Our model aims to detect compromised serverless functions by identifying post-exploitation abnormal behavior related to different types of attacks on serverless functions, and therefore, it is a last line of defense. Our approach is not tied to any specific serverless application, is agnostic to the type of threats, and is adaptable through model adjustments. To evaluate our model's performance, we developed a serverless cybersecurity testbed in an AWS cloud environment, which includes two different serverless applications and simulates a variety of attack scenarios that cover the main security threats faced by serverless functions. Our evaluation demonstrates our model's ability to detect all implemented attacks while maintaining a negligible false alarm rate.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Language-based Serverless Function Accelerator](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.02178v4)** | 2020-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing is an approach to cloud computing that allows programmers to run serverless functions in response to external events. Serverless functions are priced at sub-second granularity, support transparent elasticity, and relieve programmers from managing the operating system. Thus serverless functions allow programmers to focus on writing application code, and the cloud provider to manage computing resources globally. Unfortunately, today's serverless platforms exhibit high latency, because it is difficult to maximize resource utilization while minimizing operating costs. This paper presents serverless function acceleration, which is an approach that transparently lowers the latency and resource utilization of a large class of serverless functions. We accomplish this using language-based sandboxing, whereas existing serverless platforms employ more expensive operating system sandboxing technologies, such as containers and virtual machines. OS-based sandboxing is compatible with more programs than language-based techniques. However, instead of ruling out any programs, we use language-based sandboxing when possible, and OS-based sandboxing if necessary. Moreover, we seamlessly transition between language-based and OS-based sandboxing by leveraging the fact that serverless functions must tolerate re-execution for fault tolerance. Therefore, when a serverless function attempts to perform an unsupported operation in the language-based sandbox, we can safely re-execute it in a container. We use a new approach to trace compilation to build source-level, interprocedural, execution trace trees for serverless functions written in JavaScript. We compile trace trees to a safe subset of Rust, validate the compiler output, and link it to a runtime system. We evaluate these techniques in our implementation, which we call Containerless.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCOPE: Performance Testing for Serverless Computing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.01620v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing is a popular cloud computing paradigm that has found widespread adoption across various online workloads. It allows software engineers to develop cloud applications as a set of functions (called serverless functions). However, accurately measuring the performance (i.e., end-to-end response latency) of serverless functions is challenging due to the highly dynamic nature of the environment in which they run. To tackle this problem, a potential solution is to apply checks of performance testing techniques to determine how many repetitions of a given serverless function across a range of inputs are needed to cater to the performance fluctuation. However, the available literature lacks performance testing approaches designed explicitly for serverless computing. In this paper, we propose SCOPE, the first serverless computing-oriented performance testing approach. SCOPE takes into account the unique performance characteristics of serverless functions, such as their short execution durations and on-demand triggering. As such, SCOPE is designed as a fine-grained analysis approach. SCOPE incorporates the accuracy check and the consistency check to obtain the accurate and reliable performance of serverless functions. The evaluation shows that SCOPE provides testing results with 97.25% accuracy, 33.83 percentage points higher than the best currently available technique. Moreover, the superiority of SCOPE over the state-of-the-art holds on all functions that we study.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)</p></details> |

Unfortunately, security tools for conventional applications cannot be easily ported to serverless, and existing serverless security solutions are inadequate. In this paper, we present \emph{SecLambda}, an extensible security framework that leverages local function state and global application state to perform sophisticated security tasks to protect an application. We show how SecLambda can be used to achieve control flow integrity, credential protection, and rate limiting in serverless applications. We evaluate the performance overhead and security of SecLambda using realistic open-source applications, and our results suggest that SecLambda can mitigate several attacks while introducing relatively low performance overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Study on Serverless Workflow Service](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.03513v2)** | 2021-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Along with the wide-adoption of Serverless Computing, more and more applications are developed and deployed on cloud platforms. Major cloud providers present their serverless workflow services to orchestrate serverless functions, making it possible to perform complex applications effectively. A comprehensive instruction is necessary to help developers understand the pros and cons, and make better choices among these serverless workflow services. However, the characteristics of these serverless workflow services have not been systematically analyzed. To fill the knowledge gap, we survey four mainstream serverless workflow services, investigating their characteristics and performance. Specifically, we review their official documents and compare them in terms of seven dimensions including programming model, state management, etc. Then, we compare the performance (i.e., execution time of functions, execution time of workflows, orchestration overhead of workflows) under various experimental settings considering activity complexity and data-flow complexity of workflows, as well as function complexity of serverless functions. Finally, we discuss and verify the service effectiveness for two actual workloads. Our findings could help application developers and serverless providers to improve the development efficiency and user experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[Serverless Computing: A Security Perspective](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.03832v2)** | 2022-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless Computing is a virtualisation-related paradigm that promises to simplify application management and to solve the last challenges in the field: scale down and easy to use. The implied cost reduction, coupled with a simplified management of underlying applications, are expected to further push the adoption of virtualisation-based solutions, including cloud-computing or telco-cloud solutions. However, in this quest for efficiency, security is not ranked among the top priorities, also because of the (misleading) belief that current solutions developed for virtualised environments could be applied (as is) to this new paradigm. Unfortunately, this is not the case, due to the highlighted idiosyncratic features of serverless computing. In this paper, we review the current serverless architectures, abstract and categorise their founding principles, and provide an in depth analyse of them from the point of view of security, referring to principles and practices of the cybersecurity domain. In particular, we show the security shortcomings of the analysed serverless architectural paradigms, point to possible countermeasures, and highlight a few research directions.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, some characteristics of serverless computing, such as fragmented application boundaries, have raised new security challenges. Considerable literature work has been committed to addressing these challenges. Commercial and open-source serverless platforms implement many security measures to enhance serverless environments. This paper presents the first survey of serverless security that considers both literature work and industrial security measures. We summarize the primary security challenges, analyze corresponding solutions from the literature and industry, and identify potential research opportunities. Then, we conduct a gap analysis of the academic and industrial solutions as well as commercial and open-source serverless platforms' security capabilities, and finally, we present a complete picture of current serverless security research.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, submitted to IEEE Network</p></details> |

While Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs) offer a promising secure execution environment, their integration with serverless architectures currently faces fundamental limitations in key areas: security, performance, and resource efficiency. We present WALLET, a confidential computing system for secure serverless deployments to overcome these limitations. By employing nested confidential execution and a decoupled guest OS within CVMs, WALLET runs each function in a minimal "trustlet", significantly improving security through a reduced Trusted Computing Base (TCB). Furthermore, by leveraging a data-centric I/O architecture built upon a lightweight LibOS, WALLET optimizes network communication to address performance and resource efficiency challenges. Our evaluation shows that compared to CVM-based deployments, WALLET has 4.3x smaller TCB, improves end-to-end latency (15-93%), achieves higher function density (up to 907x), and reduces inter-function communication (up to 27x) and function chaining latency (16.7-30.2x); thus, WALLET offers a practical system for confidential serverless computing.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Serverless Scheduling Problem and NOAH](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.06100v1)** | 2018-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The serverless scheduling problem poses a new challenge to Cloud service platform providers because it is rather a job scheduling problem than a traditional resource allocation or request load balancing problem. Traditionally, elastic cloud applications use managed virtual resource allocation and employ request load balancers to orchestrate the deployment. With serverless, the provider needs to solve both the load balancing and the allocation. This work reviews the current Apache OpenWhisk serverless event load balancing and a noncooperative game-theoretic load balancing approach for response time minimization in distributed systems. It is shown by simulation that neither performs well under high system utilization which inspired a noncooperative online allocation heuristic that allows tuning the trade-off between for response time and resource cost of each serverless function.</p></details> | <details><summary>in re...</summary><p>in revision after submission to HotCloud'18</p></details> |
| **[Sizeless: Predicting the optimal size of serverless functions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15162v3)** | 2021-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless functions are a cloud computing paradigm where the provider takes care of resource management tasks such as resource provisioning, deployment, and auto-scaling. The only resource management task that developers are still in charge of is selecting how much resources are allocated to each worker instance. However, selecting the optimal size of serverless functions is quite challenging, so developers often neglect it despite its significant cost and performance benefits. Existing approaches aiming to automate serverless functions resource sizing require dedicated performance tests, which are time-consuming to implement and maintain. In this paper, we introduce an approach to predict the optimal resource size of a serverless function using monitoring data from a single resource size. As our approach does not require dedicated performance tests, it enables cloud providers to implement resource sizing on a platform level and automate the last resource management task associated with serverless functions. We evaluate our approach on three different serverless applications, where it selects the optimal memory size for 71.7% of the serverless functions and the second-best memory size for 22.3% of the serverless functions, which results in an average speedup of 43.6% while simultaneously decreasing average costs by 10.2%.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[Topology-aware Serverless Function-Execution Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.10176v2)** | 2023-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud-edge serverless applications or serverless deployments spanning multiple regions introduce the need to govern the scheduling of functions to satisfy their functional constraints or avoid performance degradation. For instance, functions may require to be allocated to specific private (edge) nodes that have access to specialised resources or to nodes with low latency to access a certain database to decrease the overall latency of the application. State-of-the-art serverless platforms do not support directly the implementation of topological constraints on the scheduling of functions. We address this problem by presenting a declarative language for defining topology-aware, function-specific serverless scheduling policies, called tAPP. Given a tAPP script, a compatible serverless scheduler can enforce different, co-existing topological constraints without requiring ad-hoc platform deployments. We prove our approach feasible by implementing a tAPP-based serverless platform as an extension of the Apache OpenWhisk serverless platform. We show that, compared to vanilla OpenWhisk, our extension does not negatively impact the performance of generic, non-topology-bound serverless scenarios, while it increases the performance of topology-bound ones.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unveiling Overlooked Performance Variance in Serverless Computing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.04309v2)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing is an emerging cloud computing paradigm for developing applications at the function level, known as serverless functions. Due to the highly dynamic execution environment, multiple identical runs of the same serverless function can yield different performance, specifically in terms of end-to-end response latency. However, surprisingly, our analysis of serverless computing-related papers published in top-tier conferences highlights that the research community lacks awareness of the performance variance problem, with only 38.38% of these papers employing multiple runs for quantifying it. To further investigate, we analyze the performance of 72 serverless functions collected from these papers. Our findings reveal that the performance of these serverless functions can differ by up to 338.76% (44.28% on average) across different runs. Moreover, 61.11% of these functions produce unreliable performance results, with a low number of repetitions commonly employed in the serverless computing literature. Our study highlights a lack of awareness in the serverless computing community regarding the well-known performance variance problem in software engineering. The empirical results illustrate the substantial magnitude of this variance, emphasizing that ignoring the variance can affect research reproducibility and result reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication in Empirical Software Engineering!</p></details> |
| **[Resource Allocation in Serverless Query Processing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.09519v1)** | 2022-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data lakes hold a growing amount of cold data that is infrequently accessed, yet require interactive response times. Serverless functions are seen as a way to address this use case since they offer an appealing alternative to maintaining (and paying for) a fixed infrastructure. Recent research has analyzed the potential of serverless for data processing. In this paper, we expand on such work by looking into the question of serverless resource allocation to data processing tasks (number and size of the functions). We formulate a general model to roughly estimate completion time and financial cost, which we apply to augment an existing serverless data processing system with an advisory tool that automatically identifies configurations striking a good balance -- which we define as being close to the "knee" of their Pareto frontier. The model takes into account key aspects of serverless: start-up, computation, network transfers, and overhead as a function of the input sizes and intermediate result exchanges. Using (micro)benchmarks and parts of TPC-H, we show that this advisor is capable of pinpointing configurations desirable to the user. Moreover, we identify and discuss several aspects of data processing on serverless affecting efficiency. By using an automated tool to configure the resources, the barrier to using serverless for data processing is lowered and the narrow window where it is cost effective can be expanded by using a more optimal allocation instead of having to over-provision the design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Characterizing Commodity Serverless Computing Platforms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.00992v3)** | 2023-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing has become a new trending paradigm in cloud computing, allowing developers to focus on the development of core application logic and rapidly construct the prototype via the composition of independent functions. With the development and prosperity of serverless computing, major cloud vendors have successively rolled out their commodity serverless computing platforms. However, the characteristics of these platforms have not been systematically studied. Measuring these characteristics can help developers to select the most adequate serverless computing platform and develop their serverless-based applications in the right way. To fill this knowledge gap, we present a comprehensive study on characterizing mainstream commodity serverless computing platforms, including AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, and Alibaba Cloud Function Compute. Specifically, we conduct both qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis. In qualitative analysis, we compare these platforms from three aspects (i.e., development, deployment, and runtime) based on their official documentation to construct a taxonomy of characteristics. In quantitative analysis, we analyze the runtime performance of these platforms from multiple dimensions with well-designed benchmarks. First, we analyze three key factors that can influence the startup latency of serverless-based applications. Second, we compare the resource efficiency of different platforms with 16 representative benchmarks. Finally, we measure their performance difference when dealing with different concurrent requests, and explore the potential causes in a black-box fashion. Based on the results of both qualitative and quantitative analysis, we derive a series of findings and provide insightful implications for both developers and cloud vendors.</p></details> |  |

This has resulted in the availability of a number of proprietary and open-source serverless solutions. We seek to understand how the performance of serverless computing depends on a number of design issues using several popular open-source serverless platforms. We identify the idiosyncrasies affecting performance (throughput and latency) for different open-source serverless platforms. Further, we observe that just having either resource-based (CPU and memory) or workload-based (request per second (RPS) or concurrent requests) auto-scaling is inadequate to address the needs of the serverless platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Serverless Nature of Blockchains and Smart Contracts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.12729v1)** | 2020-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although historically the term serverless was also used in the context of peer-to-peer systems, it is more frequently associated with the architectural style for developing cloud-native applications. From the developer's perspective, serverless architectures allow reducing management efforts since applications are composed using provider-managed components, e.g., Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) and Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) offerings. Blockchains are distributed systems designed to enable collaborative scenarios involving multiple untrusted parties. It seems that the decentralized peer-to-peer nature of blockchains makes it interesting to consider them in serverless architectures, since resource allocation and management tasks are not required to be performed by users. Moreover, considering their useful properties of ensuring transaction's immutability and facilitating accountable interactions, blockchains might enhance the overall guarantees and capabilities of serverless architectures. Therefore, in this work, we analyze how the blockchain technology and smart contracts fit into the serverless picture and derive a set of scenarios in which they act as different component types in serverless architectures. Furthermore, we formulate the implementation requirements that have to be fulfilled to successfully use blockchains and smart contracts in these scenarios. Finally, we investigate which existing technologies enable these scenarios, and analyze their readiness and suitability to fulfill the formulated requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zenix: Efficient Execution of Bulky Serverless Applications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.13444v4)** | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing, commonly offered as Function-as-a-Service, was initially designed for small, lean applications. However, there has been an increasing desire to run larger, more complex applications (what we call bulky applications) in a serverless manner. Existing strategies for enabling such applications are to either increase function sizes or to rewrite applications as DAGs of functions. These approaches cause significant resource wastage, manual efforts, and/or performance overhead. We argue that the root cause of these issues is today's function-centric serverless model, where a function is the resource allocation and scaling unit. We propose a new, resource-centric serverless-computing model for executing bulky applications in a resource- and performance-efficient way, and we build the Zenix serverless platform following this model. Our results show that Zenix reduces resource consumption by up to 90% compared to today's function-centric serverless systems, while improving performance by up to 64%.</p></details> |  |
| **[FaaSdom: A Benchmark Suite for Serverless Computing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.03271v1)** | 2020-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing has become a major trend among cloud providers. With serverless computing, developers fully delegate the task of managing the servers, dynamically allocating the required resources, as well as handling availability and fault-tolerance matters to the cloud provider. In doing so, developers can solely focus on the application logic of their software, which is then deployed and completely managed in the cloud. Despite its increasing popularity, not much is known regarding the actual system performance achievable on the currently available serverless platforms. Specifically, it is cumbersome to benchmark such systems in a language- or runtime-independent manner. Instead, one must resort to a full application deployment, to later take informed decisions on the most convenient solution along several dimensions, including performance and economic costs. FaaSdom is a modular architecture and proof-of-concept implementation of a benchmark suite for serverless computing platforms. It currently supports the current mainstream serverless cloud providers (i.e., AWS, Azure, Google, IBM), a large set of benchmark tests and a variety of implementation languages. The suite fully automatizes the deployment, execution and clean-up of such tests, providing insights (including historical) on the performance observed by serverless applications. FaaSdom also integrates a model to estimate budget costs for deployments across the supported providers. FaaSdom is open-source and available at https://github.com/bschitter/benchmark-suite-serverless-computing.</p></details> | ACM DEBS'20 |
| **[Serverless Platforms on the Edge: A Performance Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.06563v1)** | 2021-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exponential growth of Internet of Things (IoT) has given rise to a new wave of edge computing due to the need to process data on the edge, closer to where it is being produced and attempting to move away from a cloud-centric architecture. This provides its own opportunity to decrease latency and address data privacy concerns along with the ability to reduce public cloud costs. The serverless computing model provides a potential solution with its event-driven architecture to reduce the need for ever-running servers and convert the backend services to an as-used model. This model is an attractive prospect in edge computing environments with varying workloads and limited resources. Furthermore, its setup on the edge of the network promises reduced latency to the edge devices communicating with it and eliminates the need to manage the underlying infrastructure. In this book chapter, first, we introduce the novel concept of serverless edge computing, then, we analyze the performance of multiple serverless platforms, namely, OpenFaaS, AWS Greengrass, Apache OpenWhisk, when set up on the single-board computers (SBCs) on the edge and compare it with public cloud serverless offerings, namely, AWS Lambda and Azure Functions, to deduce the suitability of serverless architectures on the network edge. These serverless platforms are set up on a cluster of Raspberry Pis and we evaluate their performance by simulating different types of edge workloads. The evaluation results show that OpenFaaS achieves the lowest response time on the SBC edge computing infrastructure while serverless cloud offerings are the most reliable with the highest success rate.</p></details> |  |

| **[In-Storage Domain-Specific Acceleration for Serverless Computing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.03483v2)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While (1) serverless computing is emerging as a popular form of cloud execution, datacenters are going through major changes: (2) storage dissaggregation in the system infrastructure level and (3) integration of domain-specific accelerators in the hardware level. Each of these three trends individually provide significant benefits; however, when combined the benefits diminish. Specifically, the paper makes the key observation that for serverless functions, the overhead of accessing dissaggregated persistent storage overshadows the gains from accelerators. Therefore, to benefit from all these trends in conjunction, we propose Domain-Specific Computational Storage for Serverless (DSCS-Serverless). This idea contributes a serverless model that leverages a programmable accelerator within computational storage to conjugate the benefits of acceleration and storage disaggregation simultaneously. Our results with eight applications shows that integrating a comparatively small accelerator within the storage (DSCS-Serverless) that fits within its power constrains (15 Watts), significantly outperforms a traditional disaggregated system that utilizes the NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti GPU (250 Watts). Further, the work highlights that disaggregation, serverless model, and the limited power budget for computation in storage require a different design than the conventional practices of integrating microprocessors and FPGAs. This insight is in contrast with current practices of designing computational storage that are yet to address the challenges associated with the shifts in datacenters. In comparison with two such conventional designs that either use quad-core ARM A57 or a Xilinx FPGA, DSCS-Serverless provides 3.7x and 1.7x end-to-end application speedup, 4.3x and 1.9x energy reduction, and 3.2x and 2.3x higher cost efficiency, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Yet, serverless-ing a complex, legacy application might require major refactoring and thus is risky. As a case study, we use Airflow, an industry-standard workflow system. To reduce migration risk, we propose to limit code modifications by relying on change data capture (CDC) and message queues for internal communication. To achieve serverless efficiency, we rely on Function-as-a-Service (FaaS). Our system, sAirflow, is the first adaptation of the control plane and workers to the serverless cloud - and it maintains the same interface and most of the code. Experimentally, we show that sAirflow delivers the key serverless benefits: scaling and cost reduction. We compare sAirflow to MWAA, a managed (SaaS) Airflow. On Alibaba benchmarks on warm systems, sAirflow performs similarly while halving the monetary cost. On highly parallel workflows on cold systems, sAirflow scales out in seconds to 125 workers, reducing makespan by 2x-7x.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Energy-Efficient Serverless Computing with Hardware Isolation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08180v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing provides just-in-time infrastructure provisioning with rapid elasticity and a finely-grained pricing model. As full control of resource allocation is in the hands of the cloud provider and applications only consume resources when they actually perform work, we believe that serverless computing is uniquely positioned to maximize energy efficiency. However, the focus of current serverless platforms is to run hundreds or thousands of serverless functions from different tenants on traditional server hardware, requiring expensive software isolation mechanisms and a high degree of overprovisioning, i.e., idle servers, to anticipate load spikes. With shared caches, high clock frequencies, and many-core architectures, servers today are optimized for large, singular workloads but not to run thousands of isolated functions. We propose rethinking the serverless hardware architecture to align it with the requirements of serverless software. Specifically, we propose using hardware isolation with individual processors per function instead of software isolation resulting in a serverless hardware stack that consumes energy only when an application actually performs work. In preliminary evaluation with real hardware and a typical serverless workload we find that this could reduce energy consumption overheads by 90.63% or an average 70.8MW.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Allocation of Serverless Functions in IoT Environments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.03755v3)** | 2019-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The IoT area has grown significantly in the last few years and is expected to reach a gigantic amount of 50 billion devices by 2020. The appearance of serverless architectures, specifically highlighting FaaS, raises the question of the of using such in IoT environments. Combining IoT with a serverless architectural design can be effective when trying to make use of the local processing power that exists in a local network of IoT devices and creating a fog layer that leverages computational capabilities that are closer to the end-user. In this approach, which is placed between the device and the serverless function, when a device requests for the execution of a serverless function will decide based on previous metrics of execution if the serverless function should be executed locally, in the fog layer of a local network of IoT devices, or if it should be executed remotely, in one of the available cloud servers. Therefore, this approach allows to dynamically allocating functions to the most suitable layer.</p></details> |  |

It allows developers to focus on the application logic in the granularity of function, thereby freeing developers from tedious and error-prone infrastructure management. Meanwhile, its unique characteristic poses new challenges to the development and deployment of serverless-based applications. To tackle these challenges, enormous research efforts have been devoted. This paper provides a comprehensive literature review to characterize the current research state of serverless computing.

| **[Reliable Transactions in Serverless-Edge Architecture](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.00982v2)** | 2022-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern edge applications demand novel solutions where edge applications do not have to rely on a single cloud provider (which cannot be in the vicinity of every edge device) or dedicated edge servers (which cannot scale as clouds) for processing compute-intensive tasks. A recent computing philosophy, Sky computing, proposes giving each user ability to select between available cloud providers. In this paper, we present our serverless-edge co-design, which extends the Sky computing vision. In our serverless-edge co-design, we expect edge devices to collaborate and spawn required number of serverless functions. This raises several key challenges: (1) how will this collaboration take place, (2) what if some edge devices are compromised, and (3) what if a selected cloud provider is malicious. Hence, we design ServerlessBFT, the first protocol to guarantee Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) transactional flow between edge devices and serverless functions. We present an exhaustive list of attacks and their solutions on our serverless-edge co-design. Further, we extensively benchmark our architecture on a variety of parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the proceedings of ICDE 2023</p></details> |

| **[Imaginary Machines: A Serverless Model for Cloud Applications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00839v1)** | 2024-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms provide applications with resources that are highly elastic, quick to instantiate, accounted at fine granularity, and without the need for explicit runtime resource orchestration. This combination of the core properties underpins the success and popularity of the serverless FaaS paradigm. However, these benefits are not available to most cloud applications because they are designed for networked virtual machines/containers environments. Since such cloud applications cannot take advantage of the highly elastic resources of serverless and require run-time orchestration systems to operate, they suffer from lower resource utilization, additional management complexity, and costs relative to their FaaS serverless counterparts. We propose Imaginary Machines, a new serverless model for cloud applications. This model (1.) exposes the highly elastic resources of serverless platforms as the traditional network-of-hosts model that cloud applications expect, and (2.) it eliminates the need for explicit run-time orchestration by transparently managing application resources based on signals generated during cloud application executions. With the Imaginary Machines model, unmodified cloud applications become serverless applications. While still based on the network-of-host model, they benefit from the highly elastic resources and do not require runtime orchestration, just like their specialized serverless FaaS counterparts, promising increased resource utilization while reducing management costs.</p></details> |  |

However, in serverless environments, servers are initiated only after receiving a request, leading to increased response times. This delay is commonly known as the cold start problem. In this study, we explore the in-place scaling feature released in Kubernetes v1.27 and examine its impact on serverless computing. Our experimental results reveal improvements in request latency, with reductions ranging from 1.16 to 18.15 times across various workloads when compared to traditional cold policy.</p></details> |  |

| **[Towards Seamless Serverless Computing Across an Edge-Cloud Continuum](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02271v1)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing has emerged as an attractive paradigm due to the efficiency of development and the ease of deployment without managing any underlying infrastructure. Nevertheless, serverless computing approaches face numerous challenges to unlock their full potential in hybrid environments. To gain a deeper understanding and firsthand knowledge of serverless computing in edge-cloud deployments, we review the current state of open-source serverless platforms and compare them based on predefined requirements. We then design and implement a serverless computing platform with a novel edge orchestration technique that seamlessly deploys serverless functions across the edge and cloud environments on top of the Knative serverless platform. Moreover, we propose an offloading strategy for edge environments and four different functions for experimentation and showcase the performance benefits of our solution. Our results demonstrate that such an approach can efficiently utilize both cloud and edge resources by dynamically offloading functions from the edge to the cloud during high activity, while reducing the overall application latency and increasing request throughput compared to an edge-only deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Cost Dynamics of Serverless Computing: An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.13242v1)** | 2023-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of serverless computing has revolutionized the landscape of cloud computing, offering a new paradigm that enables developers to focus solely on their applications rather than managing and provisioning the underlying infrastructure. These applications involve integrating individual functions into a cohesive workflow for complex tasks. The pay-per-use model and nontransparent reporting by cloud providers make it difficult to estimate serverless costs, imped-ing informed business decisions. Existing research studies on serverless compu-ting focus on performance optimization and state management, both from empir-ical and technical perspectives. However, the state-of-the-art shows a lack of em-pirical investigations on the understanding of the cost dynamics of serverless computing over traditional cloud computing. Therefore, this study delves into how organizations anticipate the costs of adopting serverless. It also aims to com-prehend workload suitability and identify best practices for cost optimization of serverless applications. To this end, we conducted a qualitative (interviews) study with 15 experts from 8 companies involved in the migration and development of serverless systems. The findings revealed that, while serverless computing is highly suitable for unpredictable workloads, it may not be cost-effective for cer-tain high-scale applications. The study also introduces a taxonomy for comparing the cost of adopting serverless versus traditional cloud.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Based Misconfiguration Detection for AWS Serverless Computing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00642v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing is an emerging cloud computing paradigm that enables developers to build applications at the function level, known as serverless applications. Amazon Web Services (AWS), the leading provider in this domain, provides the Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM), the most widely adopted configuration schema for configuring and managing serverless applications through a specified file. However, misconfigurations pose a significant challenge in serverless development. Traditional data-driven techniques may struggle with serverless applications because the complexity of serverless configurations hinders pattern recognition, and it is challenging to gather complete datasets that cover all possible configurations. Leveraging vast amounts of publicly available data during pre-training, LLMs can have the potential to assist in identifying and explaining misconfigurations in serverless applications. In this paper, we introduce SlsDetector, the first framework leveraging LLMs to detect misconfigurations in serverless applications. SlsDetector utilizes effective prompt engineering with zero-shot learning to identify configuration issues. It designs multi-dimensional constraints specifically tailored to the configuration characteristics of serverless applications and leverages the Chain of Thought technique to enhance LLMs inferences. We evaluate SlsDetector on a curated dataset of 110 configuration files. Our results show that SlsDetector, based on ChatGPT-4o, achieves a precision of 72.88%, recall of 88.18%, and F1-score of 79.75%, outperforming state-of-the-art data-driven approaches by 53.82, 17.40, and 49.72 percentage points, respectively. Furthermore, we investigate the generalization capability of SlsDetector by applying recent LLMs, including Llama 3.1 (405B) Instruct Turbo and Gemini 1.5 Pro, with results showing consistently high effectiveness across these models.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, the paradigm has underwent rapid growth: there currently exist tens of serverless platforms and all global cloud providers host serverless operations. To help tune existing platforms, guide the design of new serverless approaches, and overall contribute to understanding this paradigm, in this work we present a long-term, comprehensive effort to identify, collect, and characterize 89 serverless use cases. We survey use cases, sourced from white and grey literature, and from consultations with experts in areas such as scientific computing. We study each use case using 24 characteristics, including general aspects, but also workload, application, and requirements.

While in serverless computing, application resource management and operational concerns are generally delegated to the cloud provider, ensuring that serverless applications meet their performance requirements is still a responsibility of the developers. Performance testing is a commonly used performance assessment practice; however, it traditionally requires visibility of the resource environment. Objective. In this study, we investigate whether performance tests of serverless applications are stable, that is, if their results are reproducible, and what implications the serverless paradigm has for performance tests. Method. We conduct a case study where we collect two datasets of performance test results: (a) repetitions of performance tests for varying memory size and load intensities and (b) three repetitions of the same performance test every day for ten months. Results. We find that performance tests of serverless applications are comparatively stable if conducted on the same day. However, we also observe short-term performance variations and frequent long-term performance changes. Conclusion. Performance tests for serverless applications can be stable; however, the serverless model impacts the planning, execution, and analysis of performance tests.</p></details> |  |

However, the complexity and dynamic nature of serverless applications present significant challenges to ensure system availability and performance. There are many root cause analysis (RCA) methods for microservice systems, but they are not suitable for precise modeling serverless applications. This is because: (1) Compared to microservice, serverless applications exhibit a highly dynamic nature. They have short lifecycle and only generate instantaneous pulse-like data, lacking long-term continuous information. (2) Existing methods solely focus on analyzing the running stage and overlook other stages, failing to encompass the entire lifecycle of serverless applications. To address these limitations, we propose FaaSRCA, a full lifecycle root cause analysis method for serverless applications. It integrates multi-modal observability data generated from platform and application side by using Global Call Graph. We train a Graph Attention Network (GAT) based graph auto-encoder to compute reconstruction scores for the nodes in global call graph. Based on the scores, we determine the root cause at the granularity of the lifecycle stage of serverless functions. We conduct experimental evaluations on two serverless benchmarks, the results show that FaaSRCA outperforms other baseline methods with a top-k precision improvement ranging from 21.25% to 81.63%.</p></details> | issre 2024 |

Existing cloud-based model inference systems are costly, not easy to scale, and must be trusted in handling the models and user request data. Serverless computing presents a new opportunity, as it provides elasticity and fine-grained pricing. Our goal is to design a serverless model inference system that protects models and user request data from untrusted cloud providers. It offers high performance and low cost, while requiring no intrusive changes to the current serverless platforms. To realize our goal, we leverage trusted hardware. We identify and address three challenges in using trusted hardware for serverless model inference. These challenges arise from the high-level abstraction of serverless computing, the performance overhead of trusted hardware, and the characteristics of model inference workloads. We present SeSeMI, a secure, efficient, and cost-effective serverless model inference system. It adds three novel features non-intrusively to the existing serverless infrastructure and nothing else.The first feature is a key service that establishes secure channels between the user and the serverless instances, which also provides access control to models and users' data. The second is an enclave runtime that allows one enclave to process multiple concurrent requests. The final feature is a model packer that allows multiple models to be executed by one serverless instance. We build SeSeMI on top of Apache OpenWhisk, and conduct extensive experiments with three popular machine learning models. The results show that SeSeMI achieves low latency and low cost at scale for realistic workloads.</p></details> |  |

In edge computing environments, however, the serverless model is challenged by the system heterogeneity and performance variability. In this paper, we introduce BenchFaaS, an open-source edge computing network testbed which automates the deployment and benchmarking of serverless functions. Our edge computing network considers a cluster of virtual machines and Raspberry Pis, and is designed to benchmark serverless functions under different hardware and network conditions. We measure and evaluate: (i) overhead incurred by testbed, (ii) performance of compute intensive tasks, (iii) impact of application payload size, (iv) scalability, and (v) performance of chained serverless functions. We share the lessons learnt in engineering and implementing the testbed. We present the measurement results and analyze the impact of networked infrastructure on serverless performance. The measurements indicate that a properly dimensioned edge computing network can effectively serve as a serverless infrastructure.</p></details> |  |

Different services can achieve the same result at different cost. In this paper, we study the efficiency of a serverless architecture for running highly parallelizable tasks to compare theses services in order to find the most efficient in term of performance and cost. More precisely, we look at the compute time and at the cost per task for a given task. The tasks studied is the count of the occurrence of a given word in a corpus. We compare the serverless architecture to the Apache Spark map reduce technique commonly used for this type of task. Using AWS Lambda for the serverless architecture and Amazon EMR for the Apache Spark map reduce, with similar compute power, we show that the serverless technique achieve comparable performance in term of compute time and cost. We observed that the lambda function is a great approach for real time computing, while EMR is preferable for task that require long compute time.</p></details> |  |

As modern serverless frameworks are typically deployed to extremely large scale distributed computing environments by major cloud providers, Raptor is specifically designed to exploit the property of statistically independent function execution that tends to emerge at very large scales. To demonstrate the effect of horizontal scale on function execution, our evaluation demonstrates that mean delay time improvements provided by Raptor for RSA public-private key pair generation can be accurately predicted by mutually independent exponential random variables, but only once the serverless framework is deployed in a highly available configuration and horizontally scaled across three availability zones.</p></details> |  |

This shift trades locality and statefulness for a pay-as-you-go model more suited to variable and infrequent workloads. However, the main challenge is to adapt services to the serverless paradigm while meeting functional, performance, and consistency requirements. In this work, we push the boundaries of FaaS computing by designing a serverless variant of ZooKeeper, a centralized coordination service with a safe and wait-free consensus mechanism. We define synchronization primitives to extend the capabilities of scalable cloud storage and outline a set of requirements for efficient computing with serverless. In FaaSKeeper, the first coordination service built on serverless functions and cloud-native services, we explore the limitations of serverless offerings and propose improvements essential for complex and latency-sensitive applications. We share serverless design lessons based on our experiences of implementing a ZooKeeper model deployable to clouds today.

Such analytics workflow jobs are increasingly characterized by short, fine-grained tasks with large fan-outs. These characteristics make them well-suited for a new cloud computing model called serverless computing or Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), which has become prevalent in recent years. The auto-scaling property of serverless computing platforms accommodates short tasks and bursty workloads, while the pay-per-use billing model of serverless computing providers keeps the cost of short tasks low. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the problem space of DAG scheduling in serverless computing. We identify and evaluate a set of techniques to make DAG schedulers serverless-aware. These techniques have been implemented in Wukong, a serverless, DAG scheduler attuned to AWS Lambda. Wukong provides decentralized scheduling through a combination of static and dynamic scheduling. We present the results of an empirical study in which Wukong is applied to a range of microbenchmark and real-world DAG applications. Results demonstrate the efficacy of Wukong in minimizing the performance overhead introduced by AWS Lambda --- Wukong achieves competitive performance compared to a serverful DAG scheduler, while improving the performance of real-world DAG jobs by as much as 3.1X at larger scale.</p></details> | Appears at PDSW 2019 |

Compute Express Link (CXL) is an ideal platform for serverless workloads runtime that offers a holistic memory namespace thanks to its cache coherent feature and large memory capacity. However, naively offloading Serverless applications to CXL brings substantial latencies. In this work, we first quantify CXL impacts on various Serverless applications. Second, we argue the opportunity of provisioning DRAM and CXL in a fine-grained, application-specific manner to Serverless workloads, by creating a shim layer to identify, and naively place hot regions to DRAM, while leaving cold/warm regions to CXL.

Public serverless repositories have become key to accelerating the development of serverless applications. However, their growing popularity makes them attractive targets for adversaries.

A common and important use case is to compose serverless functions and cloud storage into reliable workflows. However, existing solutions for authoring workflows provide a rudimentary experience compared to writing standard code in a modern programming language. Furthermore, executing workflows reliably in an elastic serverless environment poses significant performance challenges. To address these, we propose Durable Functions, a programming model for serverless workflows, and Netherite, a distributed execution engine to execute them efficiently. Workflows in Durable Functions are expressed as task-parallel code in a host language of choice. Internally, the workflows are translated to fine-grained stateful communicating processes, which are load-balanced over an elastic cluster. The main challenge is to minimize the cost of reliably persisting progress to storage while supporting elastic scale. Netherite solves this by introducing partitioning, recovery logs, asynchronous snapshots, and speculative communication. Our results show that Durable Functions simplifies the expression of complex workflows, and that Netherite achieves lower latency and higher throughput than the prevailing approaches for serverless workflows in Azure and AWS, by orders of magnitude in some cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was written in September 2020, and the content has not been edited after October 10, 2020</p></details> |

The serverless computing model provides an intuitive interface for developing cloud-based applications, where the development and deployment of scalable microservices has become easier and cost-effective. An increasing number of batch-processing applications are deployed as pipelines that comprise a sequence of functions that must meet their deadline targets to be practical. In this paper, we present our Hybrid Cloud Scheduler (HCS) for orchestrating the execution of serverless batch-processing pipelines deployed over heterogeneous infrastructures. Our framework enables developers to (i) automatically schedule and execute batch-processing applications in heterogeneous environments such as the private edge and public cloud serverless infrastructures, (ii) benefit from cost reduction through the utilization of their own resources in a private cluster, and (iii) significantly improves the probability of meeting the deadline requirements of their applications. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the efficiency and benefits of our approach.</p></details> |  |

As the most promising architecture for deploying microservices, serverless computing has recently attracted more and more attention in both industry and academia. Due to its inherent scalability and flexibility, serverless computing becomes attractive and more pervasive for ever-growing Internet services. Despite the momentum in the cloud-native community, the existing challenges and compromises still wait for more advanced research and solutions to further explore the potentials of the serverless computing model. As a contribution to this knowledge, this article surveys and elaborates the research domains in the serverless context by decoupling the architecture into four stack layers: Virtualization, Encapsule, System Orchestration, and System Coordination. Inspired by the security model, we highlight the key implications and limitations of these works in each layer, and make suggestions for potential challenges to the field of future serverless computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), and the current e-print version is our major revision.

It provides an interface that greatly simplifies cloud programming, and represents an evolution that parallels the transition from assembly language to high-level programming languages. This paper gives a quick history of cloud computing, including an accounting of the predictions of the 2009 Berkeley View of Cloud Computing paper, explains the motivation for serverless computing, describes applications that stretch the current limits of serverless, and then lists obstacles and research opportunities required for serverless computing to fulfill its full potential. Just as the 2009 paper identified challenges for the cloud and predicted they would be addressed and that cloud use would accelerate, we predict these issues are solvable and that serverless computing will grow to dominate the future of cloud computing.</p></details> |  |

However, while implementing complex services comprising databases, file stores, or more than one serverless function, the performance in terms of latency of serving requests often degrades severely. In this work, we analyze different serverless architectures with AWS Lambda services and compare their performance in terms of latency with a traditional virtual machine (VM) based approach. We observe that database access latency in serverless architecture is almost 14 times than that in VM based setup. Further, we introduce some caching strategies which can improve the response time significantly, and compare their performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ripple: A Practical Declarative Programming Framework for Serverless Compute](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.00222v1)** | 2020-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing has emerged as a promising alternative to infrastructure- (IaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS)cloud platforms for applications with ample parallelism and intermittent activity. Serverless promises greater resource elasticity, significant cost savings, and simplified application deployment. All major cloud providers, including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, have introduced serverless to their public cloud offerings. For serverless to reach its potential, there is a pressing need for programming frameworks that abstract the deployment complexity away from the user. This includes simplifying the process of writing applications for serverless environments, automating task and data partitioning, and handling scheduling and fault tolerance. We present Ripple, a programming framework designed to specifically take applications written for single-machine execution and allow them to take advantage of the task parallelism of serverless. Ripple exposes a simple interface that users can leverage to express the high-level dataflow of a wide spectrum of applications, including machine learning (ML) analytics, genomics, and proteomics. Ripple also automates resource provisioning, meeting user-defined QoS targets, and handles fault tolerance by eagerly detecting straggler tasks. We port Ripple over AWS Lambda and show that, across a set of diverse applications, it provides an expressive and generalizable programming framework that simplifies running data-parallel applications on serverless, and can improve performance by up to 80x compared to IaaS/PaaS clouds for similar costs.</p></details> |  |

With an Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) approach, frameworks like the Serverless Framework use YAML configurations to define and deploy APIs, tasks, workflows, and event-driven applications on cloud providers, promoting zero-friction development. As with any rapidly evolving ecosystem, there is a need for updated insights into how these tools are used in real-world projects. Building on the methodology established by the Wonderless dataset for serverless computing (and applying multiple new filtering steps), OpenLambdaVerse addresses this gap by creating a dataset of current GitHub repositories that use the Serverless Framework in applications that contain one or more AWS Lambda functions. We then analyze and characterize this dataset to get an understanding of the state-of-the-art in serverless architectures based on this stack. Through this analysis we gain important insights on the size and complexity of current applications, which languages and runtimes they employ, how are the functions triggered, the maturity of the projects, and their security practices (or lack of). OpenLambdaVerse thus offers a valuable, up-to-date resource for both practitioners and researchers that seek to better understand evolving serverless workloads.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 13th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering (IC2E 2025, accepted, to appear)</p></details> |
| **[A Serverless Publish/Subscribe System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.07897v1)** | 2022-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Operating a scalable and reliable server application, such as publish/subscribe (pub/sub) systems, requires tremendous development efforts and resources. The emerging serverless paradigm simplifies the development and deployment of highly available applications by delegating most operational concerns to the cloud providers. The serverless paradigm describes a programming model where the developers break the application downs into smaller microservices that run on the cloud in response to events. This paper proposes designing a serverless pub/sub system based on the IBM Bluemix cloud platform. Our pub/sub system performs topic-based, content-based, and function-based matchings. The function-based matching is a novel matching approach where the subscribers can define a highly customizable subscription function that the broker applies to the publications in the cloud. The evaluations of the designed system verify the practicality of the designed system. However, the vendor-specific constraints of the IBM Bluemix resources are a bottleneck to the scalability of the broker.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fifer: Tackling Underutilization in the Serverless Era](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.12819v1)** | 2020-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Datacenters are witnessing a rapid surge in the adoption of serverless functions for microservices-based applications. A vast majority of these microservices typically span less than a second, have strict SLO requirements, and are chained together as per the requirements of an application. The aforementioned characteristics introduce a new set of challenges, especially in terms of container provisioning and management, as the state-of-the-art resource management frameworks, employed in serverless platforms, tend to look at microservice-based applications similar to conventional monolithic applications. Hence, these frameworks suffer from microservice-agnostic scheduling and colossal container over-provisioning, especially during workload fluctuations, thereby resulting in poor resource utilization. In this work, we quantify the above shortcomings using a variety of workloads on a multi-node cluster managed by Kubernetes and Brigade serverless framework. To address them, we propose \emph{Fifer} -- an adaptive resource management framework to efficiently manage function-chains on serverless platforms. The key idea is to make \emph{Fifer} (i) utilization conscious by efficiently bin packing jobs to fewer containers using function-aware container scaling and intelligent request batching, and (ii) at the same time, SLO-compliant by proactively spawning containers to avoid cold-starts, thus minimizing the overall response latency. Combining these benefits, \emph{Fifer} improves container utilization and cluster-wide energy consumption by 4x and 31%, respectively, without compromising on SLO's, when compared to the state-of-the-art schedulers employed by serverless platforms.</p></details> |  |

At the same time, infrastructure advancements such as the emergence of 5G networks and the explosion of devices connected to Internet known as Internet of Things (IoT), as well as new application requirements that constrain where computation and data can happen, will expand the reach of Cloud computing beyond traditional data centers into Hybrid Cloud. Digital transformation due to the pandemic, which accelerated changes to the workforce and spurred further adoption of AI, is expected to accelerate and the emergent Hybrid Cloud market could potentially expand to over trillion dollars. In the Hybrid Cloud environment, driven by the serverless tenants there will be an increased need to focus on enabling productive work for application builders that are using a distributed platform including public clouds, private clouds, and edge systems. In this chapter we investigate how far serverless computing can be extended to become Hybrid Serverless Computing.</p></details> |  |
| **[numpywren: serverless linear algebra](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.09679v1)** | 2018-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear algebra operations are widely used in scientific computing and machine learning applications. However, it is challenging for scientists and data analysts to run linear algebra at scales beyond a single machine. Traditional approaches either require access to supercomputing clusters, or impose configuration and cluster management challenges. In this paper we show how the disaggregation of storage and compute resources in so-called "serverless" environments, combined with compute-intensive workload characteristics, can be exploited to achieve elastic scalability and ease of management. We present numpywren, a system for linear algebra built on a serverless architecture. We also introduce LAmbdaPACK, a domain-specific language designed to implement highly parallel linear algebra algorithms in a serverless setting. We show that, for certain linear algebra algorithms such as matrix multiply, singular value decomposition, and Cholesky decomposition, numpywren's performance (completion time) is within 33% of ScaLAPACK, and its compute efficiency (total CPU-hours) is up to 240% better due to elasticity, while providing an easier to use interface and better fault tolerance. At the same time, we show that the inability of serverless runtimes to exploit locality across the cores in a machine fundamentally limits their network efficiency, which limits performance on other algorithms such as QR factorization. This highlights how cloud providers could better support these types of computations through small changes in their infrastructure.</p></details> |  |

This work analyzes the applicability of serverless services for running the STAR aligner, which is known for its accuracy and large memory requirement. This presents a challenge, as serverless services were designed for light and short tasks. Nevertheless, we successfully deploy a STAR-based pipeline on AWS ECS service, propose multiple optimizations, and perform experiment with 17 TBs of data. Results are compared against standard virtual machine (VM) based solution showing that serverless is a valid alternative for small-scale batch processing. However, in large-scale where efficiency matters the most, VMs are still recommended.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CCGrid2025 conference in the poster format</p></details> |

We present an approach for securing serverless systems using a novel form of dynamic information flow control (IFC). We show that in serverless applications, the termination channel found in most existing IFC systems can be arbitrarily amplified via multiple concurrent requests, necessitating a stronger termination-sensitive non-interference guarantee, which we achieve using a combination of static labeling of serverless processes and dynamic faceted labeling of persistent data. We describe our implementation of this approach on top of JavaScript for AWS Lambda and OpenWhisk serverless platforms, and present three realistic case studies showing that it can enforce important IFC security properties with low overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[LaSS: Running Latency Sensitive Serverless Computations at the Edge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14087v1)** | 2021-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing has emerged as a new paradigm for running short-lived computations in the cloud. Due to its ability to handle IoT workloads, there has been considerable interest in running serverless functions at the edge. However, the constrained nature of the edge and the latency sensitive nature of workloads result in many challenges for serverless platforms. In this paper, we present LaSS, a platform that uses model-driven approaches for running latency-sensitive serverless computations on edge resources. LaSS uses principled queuing-based methods to determine an appropriate allocation for each hosted function and auto-scales the allocated resources in response to workload dynamics. LaSS uses a fair-share allocation approach to guarantee a minimum of allocated resources to each function in the presence of overload. In addition, it utilizes resource reclamation methods based on container deflation and termination to reassign resources from over-provisioned functions to under-provisioned ones. We implement a prototype of our approach on an OpenWhisk serverless edge cluster and conduct a detailed experimental evaluation. Our results show that LaSS can accurately predict the resources needed for serverless functions in the presence of highly dynamic workloads, and reprovision container capacity within hundreds of milliseconds while maintaining fair share allocation guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM HPDC 2021</p></details> |

It is currently gaining momentum as the next step in the evolution of hosted computing from capacitated machine virtualisation and microservices towards utility computing. The term "serverless" has become a synonym for the entirely resource-transparent deployment model of cloud-based event-driven distributed applications. This work investigates how adaptive event dispatching can improve serverless platform resource efficiency and contributes a novel approach that allows for better scaling and fitting of the platform's resource consumption to actual demand.</p></details> |  |
| **[CausalMesh: A Formally Verified Causal Cache for Stateful Serverless Computing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.15647v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stateful serverless workflows consist of multiple serverless functions that access state on a remote database. Developers sometimes add a cache layer between the serverless runtime and the database to improve I/O latency. However, in a serverless environment, functions in the same workflow may be scheduled to different nodes with different caches, which can cause non-intuitive anomalies. This paper presents CausalMesh, a novel approach to causally consistent caching in environments where a computation may migrate from one machine to another, such as in serverless computing. CausalMesh is the first cache system that supports coordination-free and abort-free read/write operations and read transactions when clients roam among multiple servers. CausalMesh also supports read-write transactional causal consistency in the presence of client roaming, but at the cost of abort-freedom. We have formally verified CausalMesh's protocol in Dafny, and our experimental evaluation shows that CausalMesh has lower latency and higher throughput than existing proposals</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version from PVLDB Volume 17, Issue 13, 2024.

Also, implementation and experimentation on real serverless platforms is both costly and time-consuming. However, at the moment, there is no comprehensive simulation tool or framework to be used instead of the real platform. As a result, in this paper, we fill this gap by proposing a simulation platform, called SimFaaS, which assists serverless application developers to develop optimized Function-as-a-Service applications in terms of cost and performance. On the other hand, SimFaaS can be leveraged by FaaS providers to tailor their platforms to be workload-aware so that they can increase profit and quality of service at the same time. Also, serverless platform providers can evaluate new designs, implementations, and deployments on SimFaaS in a timely and cost-efficient manner. SimFaaS is open-source, well-documented, and publicly available, making it easily usable and extendable to incorporate more use case scenarios in the future. Besides, it provides performance engineers with a set of tools that can calculate several characteristics of serverless platform internal states, which is otherwise hard (mostly impossible) to extract from real platforms. We show how SimFaaS facilitates the prediction of essential performance metrics such as average response time, probability of cold start, and the average number of instances reflecting the infrastructure cost incurred by the serverless computing provider. We evaluate the accuracy and applicability of SimFaaS by comparing the prediction results with real-world traces from Amazon AWS Lambda.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in "The 11th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing and Services Science (CLOSER 2021)"</p></details> |

The term captures cloud-based event-driven distributed application design and stems from its completely resource-transparent deployment model, i.e. serverless. This work thesisizes that adaptive event dispatching can improve current serverless platform resource efficiency by considering locality and dependencies. These design contemplations have also been formulated by Hendrickson et al., which identifies the requirement that "Serverless load balancers must make low-latency decisions while considering session, code and data locality". This interim report investigates the economical importance of the emerging trend and asserts that existing serverless platforms still do not optimize for data locality, whereas a variety of scheduling methods are available from distributed computing research which have proven to increase resource efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[GoldFish: Serverless Actors with Short-Term Memory State for the Edge-Cloud Continuum](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02867v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless Computing is a computing paradigm that provides efficient infrastructure management and elastic scalability. Serverless functions scale up or down based on demand, which means that functions are not directly addressable and rely on platform-managed invocation. Serverless stateless nature requires functions to leverage external services, such as object storage and KVS, to exchange data. Serverless actors have emerged as a solution to these issues. However, the state-of-the-art serverless lifecycle and event-trigger invocation force actors to leverage remote services to manage their state and exchange data, which impacts the performance and incurs additional costs and dependency on third-party services. To address these issues, in this paper, we introduce a novel serverless lifecycle model that allows short-term stateful actors, enabling actors to maintain their state between executions. Additionally, we propose a novel serverless Invocation Model that enables serverless actors to influence the processing of future messages. We present GoldFish, a lightweight WebAssembly short-term stateful serverless actor platform that provides a novel serverless actor lifecycle and invocation model. GoldFish leverages WebAssembly to provide the actors with lightweight sandbox isolation, making them suitable for the Edge-Cloud Continuum, where computational resources are limited. Experimental results show that GoldFish optimizes the data exchange latency by up to 92% and increases the throughput by up to 10x compared to OpenFaaS and Spin.</p></details> | <details><summary>14th ...</summary><p>14th International Conference on the Internet of Things (IoT 2024), November 19--22, 2024, Oulu, Finland</p></details> |

While this model offers advantages such as abstraction from the deployment and resource scheduling, it also poses limitations in handling complex use cases due to the restricted nature of individual functions. Serverless workflows address this limitation by orchestrating multiple functions into a cohesive application. However, existing serverless workflow platforms exhibit significant differences in their programming models and infrastructure, making fair and consistent performance evaluations difficult in practice. To address this gap, we propose the first serverless workflow benchmarking suite SeBS-Flow, providing a platform-agnostic workflow model that enables consistent benchmarking across various platforms. SeBS-Flow includes six real-world application benchmarks and four microbenchmarks representing different computational patterns. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on three major cloud platforms, assessing performance, cost, scalability, and runtime deviations. We make our benchmark suite open-source, enabling rigorous and comparable evaluations of serverless workflows over time.</p></details> |  |

Developers do not need to longer worry about provisioning or operating servers, and they pay only for the compute resources used when their code is run. This new cloud paradigm suits well for many applications, and researchers have already begun investigating the feasibility of serverless computing for data analytics. Unfortunately, today's serverless computing presents important limitations that make it really difficult to support all sorts of analytics workloads. This paper first starts by analyzing three fundamental trade-offs of today's serverless computing model and their relationship with data analytics. It studies how by relaxing disaggregation, isolation, and simple scheduling, it is possible to increase the overall computing performance, but at the expense of essential aspects of the model such as elasticity, security, or sub-second activations, respectively. The consequence of these trade-offs is that analytics applications may well end up embracing hybrid systems composed of serverless and serverful components, which we call Servermix in this paper. We will review the existing related work to show that most applications can be actually categorized as Servermix. Finally, this paper will introduce the major challenges of the CloudButton research project to manage these trade-offs.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 1 figure, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Cross-Edge Orchestration of Serverless Functions with Probabilistic Caching](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.04185v1)** | 2023-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless edge computing adopts an event-based paradigm that provides back-end services on an as-used basis, resulting in efficient resource utilization. To improve the end-to-end latency and revenue, service providers need to optimize the number and placement of serverless containers while considering the system cost incurred by the provisioning. The particular reason for this circumstance is that frequently creating and destroying containers not only increases the system cost but also degrades the time responsiveness due to the cold-start process. Function caching is a common approach to mitigate the coldstart issue. However, function caching requires extra hardware resources and hence incurs extra system costs. Furthermore, the dynamic and bursty nature of serverless invocations remains an under-explored area. Hence, it is vitally important for service providers to conduct a context-aware request distribution and container caching policy for serverless edge computing. In this paper, we study the request distribution and container caching problem in serverless edge computing. We prove the proposed problem is NP-hard and hence difficult to find a global optimal solution. We jointly consider the distributed and resource constrained nature of edge computing and propose an optimized request distribution algorithm that adapts to the dynamics of serverless invocations with a theoretical performance guarantee. Also, we propose a context-aware probabilistic caching policy that incorporates a number of characteristics of serverless invocations. Via simulation and implementation results, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm by outperforming existing caching policies in terms of the overall system cost and cold-start frequency by up to 62.1% and 69.1%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

A key selling point is the concept of no back-end server management, allowing developers to focus on application functionality. This is achieved through severe abstraction of the underlying architecture the functions run on. We examine the underlying architecture and report on the performance of serverless functions and how they are effected by certain factors such as memory allocation and interference caused by load induced by other users on the platform. Specifically, we focus on the serverless offerings of the four largest platforms; AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Microsoft Azure Functions and IBM Cloud Functions}. In this paper, we observe and contrast between these platforms in their approach to the common issue of "cold starts", we devise a means to unveil the underlying architecture serverless functions execute on and we investigate the effects of interference from load on the platform over the time span of one month.</p></details> |  |

Several cloud service providers (CSPs) offer serverless computing on their public clouds, but it may bring the vendor lock-in risk. To avoid this limitation, many open-source serverless platforms come out to allow developers to freely deploy and manage functions on self-hosted clouds. However, building effective functions requires much expertise and thorough comprehension of platform frameworks and features that affect performance. It is a challenge for a service developer to differentiate and select the appropriate serverless platform for different demands and scenarios. Thus, we elaborate the frameworks and event processing models of four popular open-source serverless platforms and identify their salient idiosyncrasies. We analyze the root causes of performance differences between different service exporting and auto-scaling modes on those platforms. Further, we provide several insights for future work, such as auto-scaling and metric collection.</p></details> |  |

This approach enables better resource management while being scalable, reliable, and cost-effective. However, it comes with a number of organizational and technical difficulties which stem from the interaction between the application and the cloud infrastructure, for example, having to set up a recurring task of reuploading updated files. In this paper, we present Kotless - a Kotlin Serverless Framework. Kotless is a cloud-agnostic toolkit that solves these problems by interweaving the deployed application into the cloud infrastructure and automatically generating the necessary deployment code. This relieves developers from having to spend their time integrating and managing their applications instead of developing them. Kotless has proven its capabilities and has been used to develop several serverless applications already in production.

Serverless at the edge is expected to enable low latency applications with fast autoscaling mechanisms, all running on heterogeneous and resource-constrained devices. In this work, we engineer and experimentally benchmark a serverless edge computing system architecture. We deploy a decentralized edge computing platform for serverless applications providing processing, storage, and communication capabilities using only open-source software, running over heterogeneous resources (e.g., virtual machines, Raspberry Pis, or bare metal servers, etc). To achieve that, we provision an overlay-network based on Nebula network agnostic technology, running over private or public networks, and use K3s to provide hardware abstraction. We benchmark the system in terms of response times, throughput and scalability using different hardware devices connected through the public Internet. The results show that while serverless is feasible on heterogeneous devices showing a good performance on constrained devices, such as Raspberry Pis, the lack of support when determining computational power and network characterization leaves much room for improvement in edge environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Evaluation of Serverless Cloud Infrastructure for Large-Scale Data Processing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07771v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data processing systems are increasingly deployed in the cloud. While monolithic systems run fully on virtual servers, recent systems embrace cloud infrastructure and utilize the disaggregation of compute and storage to scale them independently. The introduction of serverless compute services, such as AWS Lambda, enables finer-grained and elastic scalability within these systems. Prior work shows the viability of serverless infrastructure for scalable data processing yet also sees limitations due to variable performance and cost overhead, in particular for networking and storage. In this paper, we perform a detailed analysis of the performance and cost characteristics of serverless infrastructure in the data processing context. We base our analysis on a large series of micro-benchmarks across different compute and storage services, as well as end-to-end workloads. To enable our analysis, we propose the Skyrise serverless evaluation platform. For the widely used serverless infrastructure of AWS, our analysis reveals distinct boundaries for performance variability in serverless networks and storage. We further present cost break-even points for serverless compute and storage. These insights provide guidance on when and how serverless infrastructure can be efficiently used for data processing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Optimal Serverless Function Scaling in Edge Computing Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13896v1)** | 2023-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing has emerged as a new execution model which gained a lot of attention in cloud computing thanks to the latest advances in containerization technologies. Recently, serverless has been adopted at the edge, where it can help overcome heterogeneity issues, constrained nature and dynamicity of edge devices. Due to the distributed nature of edge devices, however, the scaling of serverless functions presents a major challenge. We address this challenge by studying the optimality of serverless function scaling. To this end, we propose Semi-Markov Decision Process-based (SMDP) theoretical model, which yields optimal solutions by solving the serverless function scaling problem as a decision making problem. We compare the SMDP solution with practical, monitoring-based heuristics. We show that SMDP can be effectively used in edge computing networks, and in combination with monitoring-based approaches also in real-world implementations.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is uploaded here for research community, thus it is for non-commercial purposes</p></details> |
| **[Towards Demystifying Serverless Machine Learning Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.07806v1)** | 2021-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The appeal of serverless (FaaS) has triggered a growing interest on how to use it in data-intensive applications such as ETL, query processing, or machine learning (ML). Several systems exist for training large-scale ML models on top of serverless infrastructures (e.g., AWS Lambda) but with inconclusive results in terms of their performance and relative advantage over "serverful" infrastructures (IaaS). In this paper we present a systematic, comparative study of distributed ML training over FaaS and IaaS. We present a design space covering design choices such as optimization algorithms and synchronization protocols, and implement a platform, LambdaML, that enables a fair comparison between FaaS and IaaS. We present experimental results using LambdaML, and further develop an analytic model to capture cost/performance tradeoffs that must be considered when opting for a serverless infrastructure. Our results indicate that ML training pays off in serverless only for models with efficient (i.e., reduced) communication and that quickly converge. In general, FaaS can be much faster but it is never significantly cheaper than IaaS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Serverless Function Scheduling at the Network Edge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.16475v2)** | 2023-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing is a promising approach for edge computing since its inherent features, e.g., lightweight virtualization, rapid scalability, and economic efficiency. However, previous studies have not studied well the issues of significant cold start latency and highly dynamic workloads in serverless function scheduling, which are exacerbated at the resource-limited network edge. In this paper, we formulate the Serverless Function Scheduling (SFS) problem for resource-limited edge computing, aiming to minimize the average response time. To efficiently solve this intractable scheduling problem, we first consider a simplified offline form of the problem and design a polynomial-time optimal scheduling algorithm based on each function's weight. Furthermore, we propose an Enhanced Shortest Function First (ESFF) algorithm, in which the function weight represents the scheduling urgency. To avoid frequent cold starts, ESFF selectively decides the initialization of new function instances when receiving requests. To deal with dynamic workloads, ESFF judiciously replaces serverless functions based on the function weight at the completion time of requests. Extensive simulations based on real-world serverless request traces are conducted, and the results show that ESFF consistently and substantially outperforms existing baselines under different settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[FaaSter Troubleshooting -- Evaluating Distributed Tracing Approaches for Serverless Applications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.03471v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless applications can be particularly difficult to troubleshoot, as these applications are often composed of various managed and partly managed services. Faults are often unpredictable and can occur at multiple points, even in simple compositions. Each additional function or service in a serverless composition introduces a new possible fault source and a new layer to obfuscate faults. Currently, serverless platforms offer only limited support for identifying runtime faults. Developers looking to observe their serverless compositions often have to rely on scattered logs and ambiguous error messages to pinpoint root causes. In this paper, we investigate the use of distributed tracing for improving the observability of faults in serverless applications. To this end, we first introduce a model for characterizing fault observability, then provide a prototypical tracing implementation - specifically, a developer-driven and a platform-supported tracing approach. We compare both approaches with our model, measure associated trade-offs (execution latency, resource utilization), and contribute new insights for troubleshooting serverless compositions.</p></details> | <details><summary>2021 ...</summary><p>2021 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering (IC2E)</p></details> |

However, rapid container provisioning introduces non-trivial challenges for FaaS cloud providers, as (i) real-world FaaS workloads may exhibit highly dynamic request patterns, (ii) applications have service-level objectives (SLOs) that must be met, and (iii) container provisioning can be a costly process. In this paper, we present SLOPE, a prediction framework for serverless FaaS platforms to address the aforementioned challenges. Specifically, it trains a neural network model that utilizes knowledge from past runs in order to estimate the number of instances required to satisfy the invocation rate requirements of the serverless applications. In cases that a priori knowledge is not available, SLOPE makes predictions using a graph edit distance approach to capture the similarities among serverless applications. Our experimental results illustrate the efficiency and benefits of our approach, which can reduce the operating costs by 66.25% on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2410.18106</p></details> |
| **[Serverless Approach to Sensitivity Analysis of Computational Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.08190v1)** | 2023-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital twins are virtual representations of physical objects or systems used for the purpose of analysis, most often via computer simulations, in many engineering and scientific disciplines. Recently, this approach has been introduced to computational medicine, within the concept of Digital Twin in Healthcare (DTH). Such research requires verification and validation of its models, as well as the corresponding sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification (VVUQ). From the computing perspective, VVUQ is a computationally intensive process, as it requires numerous runs with variations of input parameters. Researchers often use high-performance computing (HPC) solutions to run VVUQ studies where the number of parameter combinations can easily reach tens of thousands. However, there is a viable alternative to HPC for a substantial subset of computational models - serverless computing. In this paper we hypothesize that using the serverless computing model can be a practical and efficient approach to selected cases of running VVUQ calculations. We show this on the example of the EasyVVUQ library, which we extend by providing support for many serverless services. The resulting library - CloudVVUQ - is evaluated using two real-world applications from the computational medicine domain adapted for serverless execution. Our experiments demonstrate the scalability of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CCGrid2023 conference</p></details> |

| **[A Fault-Tolerance Shim for Serverless Computing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.06007v1)** | 2020-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing has grown in popularity in recent years, with an increasing number of applications being built on Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms. By default, FaaS platforms support retry-based fault tolerance, but this is insufficient for programs that modify shared state, as they can unwittingly persist partial sets of updates in case of failures. To address this challenge, we would like atomic visibility of the updates made by a FaaS application. In this paper, we present AFT, an atomic fault tolerance shim for serverless applications. AFT interposes between a commodity FaaS platform and storage engine and ensures atomic visibility of updates by enforcing the read atomic isolation guarantee. AFT supports new protocols to guarantee read atomic isolation in the serverless setting. We demonstrate that aft introduces minimal overhead relative to existing storage engines and scales smoothly to thousands of requests per second, while preventing a significant number of consistency anomalies.</p></details> |  |
| **[No more, no less - A formal model for serverless computing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.07962v2)** | 2019-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing, also known as Functions-as-a-Service, is a recent paradigm aimed at simplifying the programming of cloud applications. The idea is that developers design applications in terms of functions, which are then deployed on a cloud infrastructure. The infrastructure takes care of executing the functions whenever requested by remote clients, dealing automatically with distribution and scaling with respect to inbound traffic. While vendors already support a variety of programming languages for serverless computing (e.g. Go, Java, Javascript, Python), as far as we know there is no reference model yet to formally reason on this paradigm. In this paper, we propose the first formal programming model for serverless computing, which combines ideas from both the $λ$-calculus (for functions) and the $π$-calculus (for communication). To illustrate our proposal, we model a real-world serverless system. Thanks to our model, we are also able to capture and pinpoint the limitations of current vendor technologies, proposing possible amendments.</p></details> |  |

Machine learning tools are seen to be reliably useful, and the services created using these tools are in increasing demand on a large scale. The serverless platforms are uniquely suited for hosting these machine learning services to be used for large-scale applications. These platforms are well known for their cost efficiency, fault tolerance, resource scaling, robust APIs for communication, and global reach. However, machine learning services are different from the web-services in that these serverless platforms were originally designed to host web services. We aimed to understand how these serverless platforms handle machine learning workloads with our study. We examine machine learning performance on one of the serverless platforms - Google Cloud Run, which is a GPU-less infrastructure that is not designed for machine learning application deployment.</p></details> | 5 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Joint$λ$: Orchestrating Serverless Workflows on Jointcloud FaaS Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21899v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing serverless workflow orchestration systems are predominantly designed for a single-cloud FaaS system, leading to vendor lock-in. This restricts performance optimization, cost reduction, and availability of applications. However, orchestrating serverless workflows on Jointcloud FaaS systems faces two main challenges: 1) Additional overhead caused by centralized cross-cloud orchestration; and 2) A lack of reliable failover and fault-tolerant mechanisms for cross-cloud serverless workflows. To address these challenges, we propose Joint$λ$, a distributed runtime system designed to orchestrate serverless workflows on multiple FaaS systems without relying on a centralized orchestrator. Joint$λ$ introduces a compatibility layer, Backend-Shim, leveraging inter-cloud heterogeneity to optimize makespan and reduce costs with on-demand billing. By using function-side orchestration instead of centralized nodes, it enables independent function invocations and data transfers, reducing cross-cloud communication overhead. For high availability, it ensures exactly-once execution via datastores and failover mechanisms for serverless workflows on Jointcloud FaaS systems. We validate Joint$λ$ on two heterogeneous FaaS systems, AWS and ALiYun, with four workflows. Compared to the most advanced commercial orchestration services for single-cloud serverless workflows, Joint$λ$ reduces up to 3.3$\times$ latency, saving up to 65\% cost. Joint$λ$ is also faster than the state-of-the-art orchestrators for cross-cloud serverless workflows up to 4.0$\times$, reducing up to 4.5$\times$ cost and providing strong execution guarantees.</p></details> |  |

While most prior work on designing systems for FL has focused on using stateful always running components, recent work has shown that components in an FL system can greatly benefit from the usage of serverless computing and Function-as-a-Service technologies. To this end, distributed training of models with serverless FL systems can be more resource-efficient and cheaper than conventional FL systems. However, serverless FL systems still suffer from the presence of stragglers, i.e., slow clients due to their resource and statistical heterogeneity. While several strategies have been proposed for mitigating stragglers in FL, most methodologies do not account for the particular characteristics of serverless environments, i.e., cold-starts, performance variations, and the ephemeral stateless nature of the function instances. Towards this, we propose FedLesScan, a novel clustering-based semi-asynchronous training strategy, specifically tailored for serverless FL. FedLesScan dynamically adapts to the behaviour of clients and minimizes the effect of stragglers on the overall system. We implement our strategy by extending an open-source serverless FL system called FedLess. Moreover, we comprehensively evaluate our strategy using the 2nd generation Google Cloud Functions with four datasets and varying percentages of stragglers. Results from our experiments show that compared to other approaches FedLesScan reduces training time and cost by an average of 8% and 20% respectively while utilizing clients better with an average increase in the effective update ratio of 17.75%.</p></details> | IEEE BigData 2022 |
| **[Benchmarking, Analysis, and Optimization of Serverless Function Snapshots](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09355v3)** | 2021-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing has seen rapid adoption due to its high scalability and flexible, pay-as-you-go billing model. In serverless, developers structure their services as a collection of functions, sporadically invoked by various events like clicks. High inter-arrival time variability of function invocations motivates the providers to start new function instances upon each invocation, leading to significant cold-start delays that degrade user experience. To reduce cold-start latency, the industry has turned to snapshotting, whereby an image of a fully-booted function is stored on disk, enabling a faster invocation compared to booting a function from scratch. This work introduces vHive, an open-source framework for serverless experimentation with the goal of enabling researchers to study and innovate across the entire serverless stack. Using vHive, we characterize a state-of-the-art snapshot-based serverless infrastructure, based on industry-leading Containerd orchestration framework and Firecracker hypervisor technologies. We find that the execution time of a function started from a snapshot is 95% higher, on average, than when the same function is memory-resident. We show that the high latency is attributable to frequent page faults as the function's state is brought from disk into guest memory one page at a time. Our analysis further reveals that functions access the same stable working set of pages across different invocations of the same function. By leveraging this insight, we build REAP, a light-weight software mechanism for serverless hosts that records functions' stable working set of guest memory pages and proactively prefetches it from disk into memory. Compared to baseline snapshotting, REAP slashes the cold-start delays by 3.7x, on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ASPLOS 2021</p></details> |

| **[When is a container a comonad?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.5809v2)** | 2015-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Abbott, Altenkirch, Ghani and others have taught us that many parameterized datatypes (set functors) can be usefully analyzed via container representations in terms of a set of shapes and a set of positions in each shape. This paper builds on the observation that datatypes often carry additional structure that containers alone do not account for. We introduce directed containers to capture the common situation where every position in a data-structure determines another data-structure, informally, the sub-data-structure rooted by that position. Some natural examples are non-empty lists and node-labelled trees, and data-structures with a designated position (zippers). While containers denote set functors via a fully-faithful functor, directed containers interpret fully-faithfully into comonads. But more is true: every comonad whose underlying functor is a container is represented by a directed container. In fact, directed containers are the same as containers that are comonads. We also describe some constructions of directed containers. We have formalized our development in the dependently typed programming language Agda.</p></details> |  |

The data and laws of a directed container resemble those of a monoid, while the data and laws of a directed container morphism those of a monoid morphism in the reverse direction. With some reorganization, a directed container is the same as a small category, but a directed container morphism is opcleavage-like. We draw some conclusions for comonads from this observation, considering in particular basic constructions and concepts like the opposite category and a groupoid.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings MSFP 2016, arXiv:1604.00384</p></details> |
| **[Trusted Container Extensions for Container-based Confidential Computing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.05747v1)** | 2022-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud computing has emerged as a corner stone of today's computing landscape. More and more customers who outsource their infrastructure benefit from the manageability, scalability and cost saving that come with cloud computing. Those benefits get amplified by the trend towards microservices. Instead of renting and maintaining full VMs, customers increasingly leverage container technologies, which come with a much more lightweight resource footprint while also removing the need to emulate complete systems and their devices. However, privacy concerns hamper many customers from moving to the cloud and leveraging its benefits. Furthermore, regulatory requirements prevent the adaption of cloud computing in many industries, such as health care or finance. Standard software isolation mechanisms have been proven to be insufficient if the host system is not fully trusted, e.g., when the cloud infrastructure gets compromised by malicious third-party actors. Consequently, confidential computing is gaining increasing relevance in the cloud computing field. We present Trusted Container Extensions (TCX), a novel container security architecture, which combines the manageability and agility of standard containers with the strong protection guarantees of hardware-enforced Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to enable confidential computing for container workloads. TCX provides significant performance advantages compared to existing approaches while protecting container workloads and the data processed by them. Our implementation, based on AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV), ensures integrity and confidentiality of data and services during deployment, and allows secure interaction between protected containers as well as to external entities. Our evaluation shows that our implementation induces a low performance overhead of 5.77% on the standard SPEC2017 benchmark suite.</p></details> |  |
| **[XaaS Containers: Performance-Portable Representation With Source and IR Containers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17914v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-performance computing (HPC) systems and cloud data centers are converging, and containers are becoming the default method of portable software deployment. Yet, while containers simplify software management, they face significant performance challenges in HPC environments as they must sacrifice hardware-specific optimizations to achieve portability. Although HPC containers can use runtime hooks to access optimized MPI libraries and GPU devices, they are limited by application binary interface (ABI) compatibility and cannot overcome the effects of early-stage compilation decisions. Acceleration as a Service (XaaS) proposes a vision of performance-portable containers, where a containerized application should achieve peak performance across all HPC systems. We present a practical realization of this vision through Source and Intermediate Representation (IR) containers, where we delay performance-critical decisions until the target system specification is known. We analyze specialization mechanisms in HPC software and propose a new LLM-assisted method for automatic discovery of specializations. By examining the compilation pipeline, we develop a methodology to build containers optimized for target architectures at deployment time. Our prototype demonstrates that new XaaS containers combine the convenience of containerization with the performance benefits of system-specialized builds.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis (SC'25)</p></details> |
| **[Container Data Item: An Abstract Datatype for Efficient Container-based Edge Computing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00801v1)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Container Data Item (CDI), an abstract datatype that allows multiple containers to efficiently operate on a common data item while preserving their strong security and isolation semantics. Application developers can use CDIs to enable multiple containers to operate on the same data, synchronize execution among themselves, and control the ownership of the shared data item during runtime. These containers may reside on the same server or different servers. CDI is designed to support microservice based applications comprised of a set of interconnected microservices, each implemented by a separate dedicated container. CDI preserves the important isolation semantics of containers by ensuring that exactly one container owns a CDI object at any instant and the ownership of a CDI object may be transferred from one container to another only by the current CDI object owner. We present three different implementations of CDI that allow different containers residing on the same server as well containers residing on different servers to use CDI for efficiently operating on a common data item. The paper provides an extensive performance evaluation of CDI along with two representative applications, an augmented reality application and a decentralized workflow orchestrator.</p></details> |  |

| **[Mining Sandboxes for Linux Containers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.05493v1)** | 2017-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A container is a group of processes isolated from other groups via distinct kernel namespaces and resource allocation quota. Attacks against containers often leverage kernel exploits through system call interface. In this paper, we present an approach that mines sandboxes for containers. We first explore the behaviors of a container by leveraging automatic testing, and extract the set of system calls accessed during testing. The set of system calls then results as a sandbox of the container. The mined sandbox restricts the container's access to system calls which are not seen during testing and thus reduces the attack surface. In the experiment, our approach requires less than eleven minutes to mine sandbox for each of the containers. The enforcement of mined sandboxes does not impact the regular functionality of a container and incurs low performance overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, IEEE International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation (ICST 2017)</p></details> |
| **[Automated Cache for Container Executables](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07376v1)** | 2022-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linux container technologies such as Docker and Singularity offer encapsulated environments for easy execution of software. In high performance computing, this is especially important for evolving and complex software stacks with conflicting dependencies that must co-exist. Singularity Registry HPC ("shpc") was created as an effort to install containers in this environment as modules, seamlessly allowing for typically hidden executables inside containers to be presented to the user as commands, and as such significantly simplifying the user experience. A remaining challenge, however, is deriving the list of important executables in the container. In this work, we present new automation and methods that allow for not only discovering new containers in large community sets, but also deriving container entries with important executables. With this work we have added over 8,000 containers from the BioContainers community that can be maintained and updated by the software automation over time. All software is publicly available on the GitHub platform, and can be beneficial to container registries and infrastructure providers for automatically generating container modules to lower the usage entry barrier and improve user experience.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[Distributive Laws of Monadic Containers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17191v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Containers are used to carve out a class of strictly positive data types in terms of shapes and positions. They can be interpreted via a fully-faithful functor into endofunctors on Set. Monadic containers are those containers whose interpretation as a Set functor carries a monad structure. The category of containers is closed under container composition and is a monoidal category, whereas monadic containers do not in general compose. In this paper, we develop a characterisation of distributive laws of monadic containers. Distributive laws were introduced as a sufficient condition for the composition of the underlying functors of two monads to also carry a monad structure. Our development parallels Ahman and Uustalu's characterisation of distributive laws of directed containers, i.e. containers whose Set functor interpretation carries a comonad structure. Furthermore, by combining our work with theirs, we construct characterisations of mixed distributive laws (i.e. of directed containers over monadic containers and vice versa), thereby completing the 'zoo' of container characterisations of (co)monads and their distributive laws. We have found these characterisations amenable to development of existence and uniqueness proofs of distributive laws, particularly in the mechanised setting of Cubical Agda, in which most of the theory of this paper has been formalised.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages main text, 4 pages appendices.

Containers can encapsulate complex programs with their dependencies in isolated environments, hence are being adopted in HPC clusters. HPC workload managers lack micro-services support and deeply integrated container management, as opposed to container orchestrators (e.g. Kubernetes). We introduce Torque-Operator (a plugin) which serves as a bridge between HPC workload managers and container Orchestrators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Zhou ...</summary><p>Zhou N, Georgiou Y, Zhong L, Zhou H, Pospieszny M.

| **[Hibernate Container: A Deflated Container Mode for Fast Startup and High-density Deployment in Serverless Computing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.10963v1)** | 2023-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing is a popular cloud computing paradigm, which requires low response latency to handle on-demand user requests. There are two prominent techniques employed for reducing the response latency: keep fully initialized containers alive (Warm Container) or reduce the new container startup (cold start) latency. This paper presents the 3rd container startup mode: Hibernate Container, which starts faster than the cold start container mode and consumes less memory than the Warm Container mode. Hibernate Container is essentially a "deflated" Warm Container. Its application memory is swapped out to disk, the freed memory is reclaimed and file based mmap memory is cleaned-up. The Hibernate Container's deflated memory is inflated in response to user requests. As Hibernate Container's application is fully initialized, its response latency is less than the cold start mode; and as the application memory is deflated, its memory consumption is less than the Warm Container mode. Additionally, when a Hibernate Container is "woken up" to process a request, the Woken-up Container has similar response latency to Warm Container but less memory consumption because not all the deflated memory needs to be inflated. We implemented the Hibernate technique as part of the open source Quark secure container runtime project and our test demonstrated that Hibernate Container consumes about 7\% to 25\% of the Warm Container memory. All of this results in a higher deployment density, lower latency and appreciable improvements in the overall system performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Formalising Inductive and Coinductive Containers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02603v5)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Containers capture the concept of strictly positive data types in programming. The original development of containers is done in the internal language of locally cartesian closed categories (LCCCs) with disjoint coproducts and W-types, and uniqueness of identity proofs (UIP) is implicitly assumed throughout. Although it is claimed that these developments can also be interpreted in extensional Martin-Löf type theory, this interpretation is not made explicit. In this paper, we present a formalisation of the results that 'containers preserve least and greatest fixed points' in Cubical Agda, thereby giving a formulation in intensional type theory. Our proofs do not make use of UIP and thereby generalise the original results from talking about container functors on Set to container functors on the wild category of types. Our main incentive for using Cubical Agda is that its path type restores the equivalence between bisimulation and coinductive equality. Thus, besides developing container theory in a more general setting, we also demonstrate the usefulness of Cubical Agda's path type to coinductive proofs.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages main text.

| **[Monoid Structures on Indexed Containers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.25879v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Containers represent a wide class of type constructions relevant for functional programming and (co)inductive reasoning. Indexed containers generalize this notion to better fit the scope of dependently typed programming. When interpreting types to be sets, a container describes an endofunctor on the category of sets while an I-indexed container describes an endofunctor on the category Set^I of I-indexed families of sets. We consider the monoidal structure on the category of I-indexed containers whose tensor product of containers describes the composition of the respective induced endofunctors. We then give a combinatorial characterization of monoids in this monoidal category, and we show how these monoids correspond precisely to monads on the induced endofunctors on Set^I. Lastly, we conclude by presenting some examples of monads on Set^I that fall under our characterization, including the product of two monads, indexed variants of the state and the writer monads and an example of a free monad. The technical results of this work are accompanied by a formalization in the proof assistant Cubical Agda.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings LSFA 2025, arXiv:2509.23739</p></details> |
| **[The AGI Containment Problem](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.00545v3)** | 2016-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is considerable uncertainty about what properties, capabilities and motivations future AGIs will have. In some plausible scenarios, AGIs may pose security risks arising from accidents and defects. In order to mitigate these risks, prudent early AGI research teams will perform significant testing on their creations before use. Unfortunately, if an AGI has human-level or greater intelligence, testing itself may not be safe; some natural AGI goal systems create emergent incentives for AGIs to tamper with their test environments, make copies of themselves on the internet, or convince developers and operators to do dangerous things. In this paper, we survey the AGI containment problem - the question of how to build a container in which tests can be conducted safely and reliably, even on AGIs with unknown motivations and capabilities that could be dangerous. We identify requirements for AGI containers, available mechanisms, and weaknesses that need to be addressed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisited Containment for Graph Patterns](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.13017v1)** | 2022-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the class of conditional graph patterns (\emph{CGPs}) that allow user to query data graphs with complex patterns that contain negation and predicates. To overcome the prohibitive cost of subgraph isomorphism, we consider matching of \emph{CGPs} under simulation semantics which can be conducted in quadratic time. In emerging applications, one would like to reduce more this matching time, and the static analysis of patterns may allow ensuring part of this reduction. We study the containment problem of \emph{CGPs} that aims to check whether the matches of some pattern $P_1$, over any data graph, are contained in those of another pattern $P_2$ (written $P_1\sqsubseteq P_2$). The optimization process consists to extract matches of $P_1$ only from those of $P_2$ without querying the (possibly large) data graph. We show that the traditional semantics of containment is decidable in quadratic time, but it fails to meet the optimization goal in the presence of negation and predicates. To overcome this limit, we propose a new semantics of containment, called \emph{strong containment}, that is more suitable for \emph{CGPs} and allows to reduce their matching time. We show that \emph{strong containment} can be decided in cubic time by providing such an algorithm. We are planing to use results of this paper to answer \emph{CGPs} using views. This paper is part of an ongoing project that aims to design a caching system for complex graph patterns.</p></details> |  |

This short paper shows that the class PLC also contains PLS, a complexity class for TFNP problems that can be solved by a local search method. However, it is still open whether PLC contains the class PPA.</p></details> | <details><summary>There...</summary><p>There is a significant error in the proof of Lemma 14</p></details> |
| **[Towards Least Privilege Containers with Cimplifier](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.08410v1)** | 2016-02-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Application containers, such as Docker containers, have recently gained popularity as a solution for agile and seamless deployment of applications. These light-weight virtualization environments run applications that are packed together with their resources and configuration information, and thus can be deployed across various software platforms. However, these software ecosystems are not conducive to the true and tried security principles of privilege separation (PS) and principle of least privilege (PLP). We propose algorithms and a tool Cimplifier, which address these concerns in the context of containers. Specifically, given a container our tool partitions them into simpler containers, which are only provided enough resources to perform their functionality. As part our solution, we develop techniques for analyzing resource usage, for performing partitioning, and gluing the containers together to preserve functionality. Our evaluation on real-world containers demonstrates that Cimplifier can preserve the original functionality, leads to reduction in image size of 58-95%, and processes even large containers in under thirty seconds.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Stochastic Container Relocation Problem](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.04769v2)** | 2017-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Container Relocation Problem (CRP) is concerned with finding a sequence of moves of containers that minimizes the number of relocations needed to retrieve all containers, while respecting a given order of retrieval. However, the assumption of knowing the full retrieval order of containers is particularly unrealistic in real operations. This paper studies the stochastic CRP (SCRP), which relaxes this assumption. A new multi-stage stochastic model, called the batch model, is introduced, motivated, and compared with an existing model (the online model). The two main contributions are an optimal algorithm called Pruning-Best-First-Search (PBFS) and a randomized approximate algorithm called PBFS-Approximate with a bounded average error. Both algorithms, applicable in the batch and online models, are based on a new family of lower bounds for which we show some theoretical properties. Moreover, we introduce two new heuristics outperforming the best existing heuristics. Algorithms, bounds and heuristics are tested in an extensive computational section. Finally, based on strong computational evidence, we conjecture the optimality of the "Leveling" heuristic in a special "no information" case, where at any retrieval stage, any of the remaining containers is equally likely to be retrieved next.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bag Query Containment and Information Theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.09727v3)** | 2021-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The query containment problem is a fundamental algorithmic problem in data management. While this problem is well understood under set semantics, it is by far less understood under bag semantics. In particular, it is a long-standing open question whether or not the conjunctive query containment problem under bag semantics is decidable. We unveil tight connections between information theory and the conjunctive query containment under bag semantics. These connections are established using information inequalities, which are considered to be the laws of information theory. Our first main result asserts that deciding the validity of maxima of information inequalities is many-one equivalent to the restricted case of conjunctive query containment in which the containing query is acyclic; thus, either both these problems are decidable or both are undecidable. Our second main result identifies a new decidable case of the conjunctive query containment problem under bag semantics. Specifically, we give an exponential time algorithm for conjunctive query containment under bag semantics, provided the containing query is chordal and admits a simple junction tree.</p></details> |  |

| **[Containment of Shape Expression Schemas for RDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.07303v3)** | 2018-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of containment for shape expression schemas (ShEx) for RDF graphs. We identify a subclass of ShEx that has a natural graphical representation in the form of shape graphs and their semantics is captured with a tractable notion of embedding of an RDF graph in a shape graph. When applied to pairs of shape graphs, an embedding is a sufficient condition for containment, and for a practical subclass of deterministic shape graphs, it is also a necessary one, thus yielding a subclass with tractable containment. While for general shape graphs a minimal counter-example i.e., an instance proving non-containment, might be of exponential size, we show that containment is EXP-hard and in coNEXP. Finally, we show that containment for arbitrary ShEx is coNEXP-hard and in coTwoNEXP^NP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence Containment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.08476v1)** | 2017-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With almost daily improvements in capabilities of artificial intelligence it is more important than ever to develop safety software for use by the AI research community. Building on our previous work on AI Containment Problem we propose a number of guidelines which should help AI safety researchers to develop reliable sandboxing software for intelligent programs of all levels. Such safety container software will make it possible to study and analyze intelligent artificial agent while maintaining certain level of safety against information leakage, social engineering attacks and cyberattacks from within the container.</p></details> |  |
| **[ORCA: Unveiling Obscure Containers In The Wild](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09322v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software development increasingly depends on open-source libraries and third-party components, which are often encapsulated into containerized environments. While improving the development and deployment of applications, this approach introduces security risks, particularly when outdated or vulnerable components are inadvertently included in production environments. Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is a critical process that helps identify and manage packages and dependencies inside a container. However, unintentional modifications to the container filesystem can lead to incomplete container images, which compromise the reliability of SCA tools. In this paper, we examine the limitations of both cloud-based and open-source SCA tools when faced with such obscure images. An analysis of 600 popular containers revealed that obscure containers exist in well-known registries and trusted images and that many tools fail to analyze such containers. To mitigate these issues, we propose an obscuration-resilient methodology for container analysis and introduce ORCA (Obscuration-Resilient Container Analyzer), its open-source implementation. We reported our findings to all vendors using their appropriate channels. Our results demonstrate that ORCA effectively detects the content of obscure containers and achieves a median 40% improvement in file coverage compared to Docker Scout and Syft.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Containment Problem for Linear Sets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.04533v2)** | 2018-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is well known that the containment problem (as well as the equivalence problem) for semilinear sets is $\log$-complete in $Π_2^p$. It had been shown quite recently that already the containment problem for multi-dimensional linear sets is $\log$-complete in $Π_2^p$ (where hardness even holds for a unary encoding of the numerical input parameters). In this paper, we show that already the containment problem for $1$-dimensional linear sets (with binary encoding of the numerical input parameters) is $\log$-hard (and therefore also $\log$-complete) in $Π_2^p$. However, combining both restrictions (dimension $1$ and unary encoding), the problem becomes solvable in polynomial time.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[The Cure is in the Cause: A Filesystem for Container Debloating](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.04641v5)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Containers have become a standard for deploying applications due to their convenience, but they often suffer from significant software bloat-unused files that inflate image sizes, increase provisioning times, and waste resources. These inefficiencies are particularly problematic in serverless and edge computing scenarios, where resources are constrained, and performance is critical. Existing debloating tools are limited in scope and effectiveness, failing to address the widespread issue of container bloat at scale. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale evaluation of container bloat, analyzing the top 20 most downloaded containers on DockerHub. We evaluate two state-of-the-art debloating tools, identify their limitations, and propose a novel solution, BAFFS, which addresses bloat at the filesystem level by introducing a flexible debloating layer that preserves the layered structure of container filesystems. The debloating layer can be organized in different ways to meet diverse requirements. Our evaluation demonstrates that over 50% of the top-downloaded containers have more than 60% bloat, and BAFFS reduces container sizes significantly while maintaining functionality. For serverless functions, BAFFS reduces cold start latency by up to 68%. Additionally, when combined with lazy-loading snapshotters, BAFFS enhances provisioning efficiency, reducing conversion times by up to 93% and provisioning times by up to 19%.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we investigate the problem of containment of NREs, and show that it can be solved in PSPACE, i.e., the same complexity as the problem of containment of regular expressions or regular path queries (RPQs).</p></details> |  |
| **[WattsApp: Power-Aware Container Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00342v1)** | 2020-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Containers are becoming a popular workload deployment mechanism in modern distributed systems. However, there are limited software-based methods (hardware-based methods are expensive requiring hardware level changes) for obtaining the power consumed by containers for facilitating power-aware container scheduling, an essential activity for efficient management of distributed systems. This paper presents WattsApp, a tool underpinned by a six step software-based method for power-aware container scheduling to minimize power cap violations on a server. The proposed method relies on a neural network-based power estimation model and a power capped container scheduling technique. Experimental studies are pursued in a lab-based environment on 10 benchmarks deployed on Intel and ARM processors. The results highlight that the power estimation model has negligible overheads for data collection - nearly 90% of all data samples can be estimated with less than a 10% error, and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is less than 6%. The power-aware scheduling of WattsApp is more effective than Intel's Running Power Average Limit (RAPL) based power capping for both single and multiple containers as it does not degrade the performance of all containers running on the server. The results confirm the feasibility of WattsApp.</p></details> |  |
| **[A cost-effective rumor-containing strategy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.02767v2)** | 2018-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the issue of suppressing a rumor using the truth in a cost-effective way. First, an individual-level dynamical model capturing the rumor-truth mixed spreading processes is proposed. On this basis, the cost-effective rumor-containing problem is modeled as an optimization problem. Extensive experiments show that finding a cost-effective rumor-containing strategy boils down to enhancing the first truth-spreading rate until the cost effectiveness of the rumor-containing strategy reaches the first turning point. This finding greatly reduces the time spent for solving the optimization problem. The influences of different factors on the optimal cost effectiveness of a rumor-containing strategy are examined through computer simulations. We believe our findings help suppress rumors in a cost-effective way. To our knowledge, this is the first time the rumor-containing problem is treated this way.</p></details> |  |

We study here the containment problem for Conjunctive Regular Path Queries (CRPQs), a navigational query language extensively used in ontology and graph database querying. While it is known that containment of CRPQs is expspace-complete in general, we focus here on severely restricted fragments, which are known to be highly relevant in practice according to several recent studies. We obtain a detailed overview of the complexity of the containment problem, depending on the features used in the regular expressions of the queries, with completeness results for np, pitwo, pspace or expspace.</p></details> |  |
| **[Minimizing privilege for building HPC containers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07508v3)** | 2022-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>HPC centers face increasing demand for software flexibility, and there is growing consensus that Linux containers are a promising solution. However, existing container build solutions require root privileges and cannot be used directly on HPC resources. This limitation is compounded as supercomputer diversity expands and HPC architectures become more dissimilar from commodity computing resources. Our analysis suggests this problem can best be solved with low-privilege containers. We detail relevant Linux kernel features, propose a new taxonomy of container privilege, and compare two open-source implementations: mostly-unprivileged rootless Podman and fully-unprivileged Charliecloud. We demonstrate that low-privilege container build on HPC resources works now and will continue to improve, giving normal users a better workflow to securely and correctly build containers. Minimizing privilege in this way can improve HPC user and developer productivity as well as reduce support workload for exascale applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 11 figures.

| **[Primrose: Selecting Container Data Types by Their Properties](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.09655v3)** | 2023-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Container data types are ubiquitous in computer programming, enabling developers to efficiently store and process collections of data with an easy-to-use programming interface. Many programming languages offer a variety of container implementations in their standard libraries based on data structures offering different capabilities and performance characteristics. Inquiry: Choosing the *best* container for an application is not always straightforward, as performance characteristics can change drastically in different scenarios, and as real-world performance is not always correlated to theoretical complexity. Approach: We present Primrose, a language-agnostic tool for selecting the best performing valid container implementation from a set of container data types that satisfy *properties* given by application developers. Primrose automatically selects the set of valid container implementations for which the *library specifications*, written by the developers of container libraries, satisfies the specified properties. Finally, Primrose ranks the valid library implementations based on their runtime performance. Knowledge: With Primrose, application developers can specify the expected behaviour of a container as a type refinement with *semantic properties*, e.g., if the container should only contain unique values (such as a `set`) or should satisfy the LIFO property of a `stack`. Semantic properties nicely complement *syntactic properties* (i.e., traits, interfaces, or type classes), together allowing developers to specify a container's programming interface *and* behaviour without committing to a concrete implementation. Grounding: We present our prototype implementation of Primrose that preprocesses annotated Rust code, selects valid container implementations and ranks them on their performance. The design of Primrose is, however, language-agnostic, and is easy to integrate into other programming languages that support container data types and traits, interfaces, or type classes. Our implementation encodes properties and library specifications into verification conditions in Rosette, an interface for SMT solvers, which determines the set of valid container implementations. We evaluate Primrose by specifying several container implementations, and measuring the time taken to select valid implementations for various combinations of properties with the solver. We automatically validate that container implementations conform to their library specifications via property-based testing. Importance: This work provides a novel approach to bring abstract modelling and specification of container types directly into the programmer's workflow. Instead of selecting concrete container implementations, application programmers can now work on the level of specification, merely stating the behaviours they require from their container types, and the best implementation can be selected automatically.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adapting a Container Infrastructure for Autonomous Vehicle Development](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.01075v2)** | 2019-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of Autonomous Vehicle (AV) development, having a robust yet flexible infrastructure enables code to be continuously integrated and deployed, which in turn accelerates the rapid prototyping process. The platform-agnostic and scalable container infrastructure, often exploited by developers in the cloud domain, presents a viable solution addressing this need in AV development. Developers use tools such as Docker to build containers and Kubernetes to setup container networks. This paper presents a container infrastructure strategy for AV development, discusses the scenarios in which this strategy is useful and performs an analysis on container boundary overhead, and its impact on a Mix Critical System (MCS). An experiment was conducted to compare both operation runtime and communication delay of running a Gaussian Seidel Algorithm with I/O in four different environments: native OS, new container, existing container, and nested container. The comparison reveals that running in containers indeed adds a delay to signal response time, but behaves more deterministically and that nested container does not stack up delays but makes the process less deterministic. With these concerns in mind, the developers may be more informed when setting up the container infrastructure, and take full advantage of the new infrastructure while avoiding some common pitfalls.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be submitted to IEEE CCWC, JAN 2020</p></details> |

Container technology is a new cloud technology that boosts the booting of applications, increases the ability to deploy applications on containers and improves the host machine resource sharing. Thus, enhancing a cloud container system needs a robust algorithm that deploys the applications efficiently. Most of the schedulers associated with container technology are focused on load balancing for increasing container performance. The traffic over networks plays a significant role in the performance of containers. Container deployment considering only load balancing may not be the best scheduling strategy due to the dependency between the applications that might be deployed in different pods (zones) in the container's cloud. This project aims to develop an algorithm that deploys applications into containers by considering the dependencies between applications as well as load balancing. The proposed algorithm performs better in terms of improving the throughput and reducing the network traffic as compared to state-of-the-art container scheduling algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>68 pa...</summary><p>68 pages, 35 figures and 6 tables</p></details> |

| **[C-Balancer: A System for Container Profiling and Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08912v1)** | 2020-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linux containers have gained high popularity in recent times. This popularity is significantly due to various advantages of containers over Virtual Machines (VM). The containers are lightweight, occupy lesser storage, have fast boot-up time, easy to deploy and have faster auto-scaling. The key reason behind the popularity of containers is that they leverage the mechanism of micro-service style software development, where applications are designed as independently deployable services. There are various container orchestration tools for deploying and managing the containers in the cluster. The prominent among them are Docker Swarm and Kubernetes. However, they do not address the effects of resource contention when multiple containers are deployed on a node. Moreover, they do not provide support for container migration in the event of an attack or increased resource contention. To address such issues, we propose C-Balancer, a scheduling framework for efficient placement of containers in the cluster environment. C-Balancer works by periodically profiling the containers and deciding the optimal container to node placement. Our proposed approach improves the performance of containers in terms of resource utilization and throughput. Experiments using a workload mix of Stress-NG and iPerf benchmark shows that our proposed approach achieves a maximum performance improvement of 58% for the workload mix. Our approach also reduces the variance in resource utilization across the cluster by 60% on average.</p></details> | 10 Pages |
| **[Secure Namespaced Kernel Audit for Containers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.02481v1)** | 2021-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the wide usage of container-based cloud computing, container auditing for security analysis relies mostly on built-in host audit systems, which often lack the ability to capture high-fidelity container logs. State-of-the-art reference-monitor-based audit techniques greatly improve the quality of audit logs, but their system-wide architecture is too costly to be adapted for individual containers. Moreover, these techniques typically require extensive kernel modifications, making them difficult to deploy in practical settings. In this paper, we present saBPF (secure audit BPF), an extension of the eBPF framework capable of deploying secure system-level audit mechanisms at the container granularity. We demonstrate the practicality of saBPF in Kubernetes by designing an audit framework, an intrusion detection system, and a lightweight access control mechanism. We evaluate saBPF and show that it is comparable in performance and security guarantees to audit systems from the literature that are implemented directly in the kernel.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Batch Auction Design For Cloud Container Services](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.05896v1)** | 2018-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud containers represent a new, light-weight alternative to virtual machines in cloud computing. A user job may be described by a container graph that specifies the resource profile of each container and container dependence relations. This work is the first in the cloud computing literature that designs efficient market mechanisms for container based cloud jobs. Our design targets simultaneously incentive compatibility, computational efficiency, and economic efficiency. It further adapts the idea of batch online optimization into the paradigm of mechanism design, leveraging agile creation of cloud containers and exploiting delay tolerance of elastic cloud jobs. The new and classic techniques we employ include: (i) compact exponential optimization for expressing and handling non-traditional constraints that arise from container dependence and job deadlines; (ii) the primal-dual schema for designing efficient approximation algorithms for social welfare maximization; and (iii) posted price mechanisms for batch decision making and truthful payment design. Theoretical analysis and trace-driven empirical evaluation verify the efficacy of our container auction algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Containment Graphs, Posets, and Related Classes of Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.07414v1)** | 2019-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the notion of the containment graph of a family of sets and containment classes of graphs and posets. Let $Z$ be a family of nonempty sets. We call a (simple, finite) graph G = (V, E) a $Z$-containment graph provided one can assign to each vertex $v_i \in V $ a set $S_i \in Z$ such that $v_i v_j \in E$ if and only if $S_i \subset S_j$ or $S_j \subset S_i$ . Similarly, we call a (strict) partially ordered set $P = (V, <)$ a $Z$-containment poset if to each $v_i \in V $ we can assign a set $S_i \in Z$ such that $v_i < v_j$ if and only if $S_i \subset S_j$. Obviously, $G$ is the comparability graph of $P$. We give some basic results on containment graphs and investigate the containment graphs of iso-oriented boxes in $d$-space. We present a characterization of those classes of posets and graphs that have containment representations by sets of a specific type, and we extend our results to ``injective'' containment classes. After that we discuss similar characterizations for intersection, overlap, and disjointedness classes of graphs. Finally, in the last section we discuss the nonexistence of a characterization theorem for ``strong'' containment classes of graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Formal Model for Composable Container Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.01107v1)** | 2019-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern cloud-based architectures, containers play a central role: they provide powerful isolation mechanisms such that developers can focus on the logic and dependencies of applications while system administrators can focus on deployment and management issue. In this work, we propose a formal model for container-based systems, using the framework of Bigraphical Reactive Systems (BRSs). We first introduce local directed bigraphs, a graph-based formalism which allows us to deal with localized resources. Then, we define a signature for modelling containers and provide some examples of bigraphs modelling containers. These graphs can be analysed and manipulated using techniques from graph theory: properties about containers can be formalized as properties of the corresponding bigraphic representations. Moreover, it turns out that the composition of containers as performed by e.g. docker-compose, corresponds precisely to the composition of the corresponding bigraphs inside an ``environment bigraph'' which in turn is obtained directly from the YAML file used to define the composition of containers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Algorithms for Shipping Container Delivery Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.17789v1)** | 2023-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by distribution problems arising in the supply chain of Haleon, we investigate a discrete optimization problem that we call the "container delivery scheduling problem". The problem models a supplier dispatching ordered products with shipping containers from manufacturing sites to distribution centers, where orders are collected by the buyers at agreed due times. The supplier may expedite or delay item deliveries to reduce transshipment costs at the price of increasing inventory costs, as measured by the number of containers and distribution center storage/backlog costs, respectively. The goal is to compute a delivery schedule attaining good trade-offs between the two. This container delivery scheduling problem is a temporal variant of classic bin packing problems, where the item sizes are not fixed, but depend on the item due times and delivery times. An approach for solving the problem should specify a batching policy for container consolidation and a scheduling policy for deciding when each container should be delivered. Based on the available item due times, we develop algorithms with sequential and nested batching policies as well as on-time and delay-tolerant scheduling policies. We elaborate on the problem's hardness and substantiate the proposed algorithms with positive and negative approximation bounds, including the derivation of an algorithm achieving an asymptotically tight 2-approximation ratio.</p></details> |  |
| **[Container Morphisms for Composable Interactive Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16713v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper provides a mathematical framework for client-server communication that results in a modular and type-safe architecture. It is informed and motivated by the software engineering practice of developing server backends with a database layer and a frontend, all of which communicate with a notion of request/response. I make use of dependent types to ensure the request/response relation matches and show how this idea fits in the broader context of containers and their morphisms. Using the category of containers and their monoidal products, I define monads on containers that mimic their functional programming counterparts, and using the Kleene star, I describe stateful protocols in the same system.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, submitted to APLAS, 4 pages of appendix with proofs</p></details> |
| **[Evaluation of Docker Containers for Scientific Workloads in the Cloud](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08415v1)** | 2019-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The HPC community is actively researching and evaluating tools to support execution of scientific applications in cloud-based environments. Among the various technologies, containers have recently gained importance as they have significantly better performance compared to full-scale virtualization, support for microservices and DevOps, and work seamlessly with workflow and orchestration tools. Docker is currently the leader in containerization technology because it offers low overhead, flexibility, portability of applications, and reproducibility. Singularity is another container solution that is of interest as it is designed specifically for scientific applications. It is important to conduct performance and feature analysis of the container technologies to understand their applicability for each application and target execution environment. This paper presents a (1) performance evaluation of Docker and Singularity on bare metal nodes in the Chameleon cloud (2) mechanism by which Docker containers can be mapped with InfiniBand hardware with RDMA communication and (3) analysis of mapping elements of parallel workloads to the containers for optimal resource management with container-ready orchestration tools. Our experiments are targeted toward application developers so that they can make informed decisions on choosing the container technologies and approaches that are suitable for their HPC workloads on cloud infrastructure. Our performance analysis shows that scientific workloads for both Docker and Singularity based containers can achieve near-native performance. Singularity is designed specifically for HPC workloads. However, Docker still has advantages over Singularity for use in clouds as it provides overlay networking and an intuitive way to run MPI applications with one container per rank for fine-grained resources allocation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolutionary RL for Container Loading](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06664v1)** | 2018-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loading the containers on the ship from a yard, is an impor- tant part of port operations. Finding the optimal sequence for the loading of containers, is known to be computationally hard and is an example of combinatorial optimization, which leads to the application of simple heuristics in practice. In this paper, we propose an approach which uses a mix of Evolutionary Strategies and Reinforcement Learning (RL) tech- niques to find an approximation of the optimal solution. The RL based agent uses the Policy Gradient method, an evolutionary reward strategy and a Pool of good (not-optimal) solutions to find the approximation. We find that the RL agent learns near-optimal solutions that outperforms the heuristic solutions. We also observe that the RL agent assisted with a pool generalizes better for unseen problems than an RL agent without a pool. We present our results on synthetic data as well as on subsets of real-world problems taken from container terminal. The results validate that our approach does comparatively better than the heuristics solutions available, and adapts to unseen problems better.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 Pag...</summary><p>6 Pages, 2 figures, accepted in ESANN 2018</p></details> |
| **[A Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis of Container Engines](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04080v1)** | 2023-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Containerization is a virtualization technique that allows one to create and run executables consistently on any infrastructure. Compared to virtual machines, containers are lighter since they do not bundle a (guest) operating system but they share its kernel, and they only include the files, libraries, and dependencies that are required to properly execute a process. In the past few years, multiple container engines (i.e., tools for configuring, executing, and managing containers) have been developed ranging from some that are ``general purpose'', and mostly employed for Cloud executions, to others that are built for specific contexts, namely Internet of Things and High-Performance Computing. Given the importance of this technology for many practitioners and researchers, this paper analyses six state-of-the-art container engines and compares them through a comprehensive study of their characteristics and performance. The results are organized around 10 findings that aim to help the readers understand the differences among the technologies and help them choose the best approach for their needs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Negated String Containment is Decidable (Technical Report)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22061v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We provide a positive answer to a long-standing open question of the decidability of the not-contains string predicate. Not-contains is practically relevant, for instance in symbolic execution of string manipulating programs. Particularly, we show that the predicate $\neg\mathit{Contains}(x_1 \ldots x_n, y_1 \ldots y_m)$, where $x_1 \ldots x_n$ and $y_1 \ldots y_m$ are sequences of string variables constrained by regular languages, is decidable. Decidability of a not-contains predicate combined with chain-free word equations and regular membership constraints follows.</p></details> |  |
| **[BPFContain: Fixing the Soft Underbelly of Container Security](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06972v1)** | 2021-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linux containers currently provide limited isolation guarantees. While containers separate namespaces and partition resources, the patchwork of mechanisms used to ensure separation cannot guarantee consistent security semantics. Even worse, attempts to ensure complete coverage results in a mishmash of policies that are difficult to understand or audit. Here we present BPFContain, a new container confinement mechanism designed to integrate with existing container management systems. BPFContain combines a simple yet flexible policy language with an eBPF-based implementation that allows for deployment on virtually any Linux system running a recent kernel. In this paper, we present BPFContain's policy language, describe its current implementation as integrated into docker, and present benchmarks comparing it with current container confinement technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Containers for portable, productive and performant scientific computing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.07573v2)** | 2017-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Containers are an emerging technology that hold promise for improving productivity and code portability in scientific computing. We examine Linux container technology for the distribution of a non-trivial scientific computing software stack and its execution on a spectrum of platforms from laptop computers through to high performance computing (HPC) systems. We show on a workstation and a leadership-class HPC system that when deployed appropriately there are no performance penalties running scientific programs inside containers. For Python code run on large parallel computers, the run time is reduced inside a container due to faster library imports. The software distribution approach and data that we present will help developers and users decide on whether container technology is appropriate for them. We also provide guidance for the vendors of HPC systems that rely on proprietary libraries for performance on what they can do to make containers work seamlessly and without performance penalty.</p></details> |  |
| **[Containers Placement and Migration on Cloud System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.08695v1)** | 2020-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, many businesses are using cloud computing to obtain an entire IT infrastructure remotely while delegating its management to a third party. The provider of this architecture ensures the operation and maintenance of the services while offering management capabilities via web consoles.These providers offer solutions based on bare metal or virtualization platforms (mainly virtual machines). Recently, a new type of virtualization-based on containerization technology has emerged. Containers can be deployed on bare metal servers or in virtual machines. The migration of virtual machines (VMs) and Containers in Dynamic Resource Management (DRM) is a crucial factor in minimizing the operating costs of data centers by reducing their energy consumption and subsequently limiting their impact on climate change.In this article, live migration for both types of virtualization will be studied. for that, container placement and migration algorithms are proposed, which takes into account the QoS requirements of different users in order to minimize energy consumption. Thus, a dynamic approach is suggested based on a threshold of RAM usage for host and virtual machines in the data center to avoid unnecessary power consumption. In this paper, the proposed work is compared with VM/Container placement and migration methods, the results of the experiment indicate that using container migration instead of VMs demonstrates a reduction in power consumption, and also reduces the migration time which impacts QoS and reduces SLA violation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages , 16 figures</p></details> |
| **[On Misinformation Containment in Online Social Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.06486v2)** | 2018-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread online misinformation could cause public panic and serious economic damages. The misinformation containment problem aims at limiting the spread of misinformation in online social networks by launching competing campaigns. Motivated by realistic scenarios, we present the first analysis of the misinformation containment problem for the case when an arbitrary number of cascades are allowed. This paper makes four contributions. First, we provide a formal model for multi-cascade diffusion and introduce an important concept called as cascade priority. Second, we show that the misinformation containment problem cannot be approximated within a factor of $Ω(2^{\log^{1-ε}n^4})$ in polynomial time unless $NP \subseteq DTIME(n^{\polylog{n}})$. Third, we introduce several types of cascade priority that are frequently seen in real social networks. Finally, we design novel algorithms for solving the misinformation containment problem. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is supported by encouraging experimental results.</p></details> | NIPS 2018 |
| **[bypass4netns: Accelerating TCP/IP Communications in Rootless Containers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00365v1)** | 2024-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>"Rootless containers" is a concept to run the entire container runtimes and containers without the root privileges. It protects the host environment from attackers exploiting container runtime vulnerabilities. However, when rootless containers communicate with external endpoints, the network performance is low compared to rootful containers because of the overhead of rootless networking components. In this paper, we propose bypass4netns that accelerates TCP/IP communications in rootless containers by bypassing slow networking components. bypass4netns uses sockets allocated on the host. It switches sockets in containers to the host's sockets by intercepting syscalls and injecting the file descriptors using Seccomp. Our method with Seccomp can handle statically linked applications that previous works could not handle. Also, we propose high-performance rootless multi-node communication. We confirmed that rootless containers with bypass4netns achieve more than 30x faster throughput than rootless containers without it. In addition, we evaluated performance with applications and it showed large improvements on some applications.</p></details> | 11 pages, 12 figures |
