| **[Agora: Trust Less and Open More in Verification for Confidential Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15062v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary verification plays a pivotal role in software security, yet building a verification service that is both open and trustworthy poses a formidable challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel binary verification service, AGORA, scrupulously designed to overcome the challenge. At the heart of this approach lies a strategic insight: certain tasks can be delegated to untrusted entities, while the corresponding validators are securely housed within the trusted computing base (TCB). AGORA can validate untrusted assertions generated for versatile policies. Through a novel blockchain-based bounty task manager, it also utilizes crowdsourcing to remove trust in theorem provers. These synergistic techniques successfully ameliorate the TCB size burden associated with two procedures: binary analysis and theorem proving. The design of AGORA allows untrusted parties to participate in these complex processes. Moreover, based on running the optimized TCB within trusted execution environments and recording the verification process on a blockchain, the public can audit the correctness of verification results. By implementing verification workflows for software-based fault isolation policy and side-channel mitigation, our evaluation demonstrates the efficacy of AGORA.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in OOPSLA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Confidential LLM Inference: Performance and Cost Across CPU and GPU TEEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18886v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed on converged Cloud and High-Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructure. However, as LLMs handle confidential inputs and are fine-tuned on costly, proprietary datasets, their heightened security requirements slow adoption in privacy-sensitive sectors such as healthcare and finance. We investigate methods to address this gap and propose Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) as a solution for securing end-to-end LLM inference. We validate their practicality by evaluating these compute-intensive workloads entirely within CPU and GPU TEEs. On the CPU side, we conduct an in-depth study running full Llama2 inference pipelines (7B, 13B, 70B) inside Intel's TDX and SGX, accelerated by Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX). We derive 12 insights, including that across various data types, batch sizes, and input lengths, CPU TEEs impose under 10% throughput and 20% latency overheads, further reduced by AMX. We run LLM inference on NVIDIA H100 Confidential Compute GPUs, contextualizing our CPU findings and observing throughput penalties of 4-8% that diminish as batch and input sizes grow. By comparing performance, cost, and security trade-offs, we show how CPU TEEs can be more cost-effective or secure than their GPU counterparts. To our knowledge, our work is the first to comprehensively demonstrate the performance and practicality of modern TEEs across both CPUs and GPUs for enabling confidential LLMs (cLLMs).</p></details> |  |
| **[Dstack: A Zero Trust Framework for Confidential Containers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11555v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Web3 applications require execution platforms that maintain confidentiality and integrity without relying on centralized trust authorities. While Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) offer promising capabilities for confidential computing, current implementations face significant limitations when applied to Web3 contexts, particularly in security reliability, censorship resistance, and vendor independence. This paper presents dstack, a comprehensive framework that transforms raw TEE technology into a true Zero Trust platform. We introduce three key innovations: (1) Portable Confidential Containers that enable seamless workload migration across heterogeneous TEE environments while maintaining security guarantees, (2) Decentralized Code Management that leverages smart contracts for transparent governance of TEE applications, and (3) Verifiable Domain Management that ensures secure and verifiable application identity without centralized authorities. These innovations are implemented through three core components: dstack-OS, dstack-KMS, and dstack-Gateway. Together, they demonstrate how to achieve both the performance advantages of VM-level TEE solutions and the trustless guarantees required by Web3 applications. Our evaluation shows that dstack provides comprehensive security guarantees while maintaining practical usability for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Characterizing Trust Boundary Vulnerabilities in TEE Containers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20962v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) have emerged as a cornerstone of confidential computing, garnering significant attention from both academia and industry. To enable the secure development, execution, and deployment, of applications on TEE platforms, TEE containers have been introduced as middleware solutions. These containers aim to shield applications from potentially malicious operating systems and orchestration interfaces while maintaining usability and reliability. In this paper, we analyze the isolation strategies employed by existing TEE containers to protect secure applications. To address the challenges in analyzing these interfaces, we designed an automated analyzer to precisely identify and evaluate their isolation boundaries. We observed that some TEE containers fail to achieve their intended goals due to critical design and implementation flaws, such as information leakage, rollback attacks, denial-of-service, and Iago attacks, which pose significant security risks. Drawing from our findings, we share key lessons to guide the development of more secure container solutions and discuss emerging trends in TEE containerization design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Characterization of GPU TEE Overheads in Distributed Data Parallel ML Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11771v3)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential computing (CC) or trusted execution enclaves (TEEs) is now the most common approach to enable secure computing in the cloud. The recent introduction of GPU TEEs by NVIDIA enables machine learning (ML) models to be trained without leaking model weights or data to the cloud provider. However, the potential performance implications of using GPU TEEs for ML training are not well characterized. In this work, we present an in-depth characterization study on performance overhead associated with running distributed data parallel (DDP) ML training with GPU Trusted Execution Environments (TEE). Our study reveals the performance challenges in DDP training within GPU TEEs. DDP uses ring-all-reduce, a well-known approach, to aggregate gradients from multiple devices. Ring all-reduce consists of multiple scatter-reduce and all-gather operations. In GPU TEEs only the GPU package (GPU and HBM memory) is trusted. Hence, any data communicated outside the GPU packages must be encrypted and authenticated for confidentiality and integrity verification. Hence, each phase of the ring-all-reduce requires encryption and message authentication code (MAC) generation from the sender, and decryption and MAC authentication on the receiver. As the number of GPUs participating in DDP increases, the overhead of secure inter-GPU communication during ring-all-reduce grows proportionally. Additionally, larger models lead to more asynchronous all-reduce operations, exacerbating the communication cost. Our results show that with four GPU TEEs, depending on the model that is being trained, the runtime per training iteration increases by an average of 8x and up to a maximum of 41.6x compared to DDP training without TEE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Confidential Serverless Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21518v3)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although serverless computing offers compelling cost and deployment simplicity advantages, a significant challenge remains in securely managing sensitive data as it flows through the network of ephemeral function executions in serverless computing environments within untrusted clouds. While Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs) offer a promising secure execution environment, their integration with serverless architectures currently faces fundamental limitations in key areas: security, performance, and resource efficiency. We present WALLET, a confidential computing system for secure serverless deployments to overcome these limitations. By employing nested confidential execution and a decoupled guest OS within CVMs, WALLET runs each function in a minimal "trustlet", significantly improving security through a reduced Trusted Computing Base (TCB). Furthermore, by leveraging a data-centric I/O architecture built upon a lightweight LibOS, WALLET optimizes network communication to address performance and resource efficiency challenges. Our evaluation shows that compared to CVM-based deployments, WALLET has 4.3x smaller TCB, improves end-to-end latency (15-93%), achieves higher function density (up to 907x), and reduces inter-function communication (up to 27x) and function chaining latency (16.7-30.2x); thus, WALLET offers a practical system for confidential serverless computing.</p></details> |  |
| **[HSM and TPM Failures in Cloud: A Real-World Taxonomy and Emerging Defenses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17655v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As cloud infrastructure becomes the backbone of modern organizations, the security of cryptographic key management, especially using Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) and Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs), faces unprecedented challenges. While these hardware-based solutions offer strong protection in isolated environments, their effectiveness is being undermined by cloud-native threats such as misconfigurations, compromised APIs, and lateral privilege escalations. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of publicly disclosed attacks and breaches involving HSMs and TPMs in cloud environments, identifying recurring architectural and operational flaws. We propose a taxonomy of attack vectors based on real-world case studies and threat intelligence reports, highlighting the gaps between hardware trust anchors and dynamic cloud ecosystems. Furthermore, we evaluate emerging defensive paradigms: confidential computing, post-quantum cryptography, and decentralized key management systems (dKMS), assessing their potential to address these gaps. Our findings emphasize that securing cloud-based cryptographic trust requires a layered, context-aware approach that integrates both hardware and software safeguards. The study serves as a practical framework for cloud architects and security engineers to reassess key protection strategies in light of evolving threats. To our knowledge, this is the first work to synthesize documented, real-world cloud HSM and TPM failures into a coherent taxonomy grounded in modern threat models.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 Flowcharts, 2 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Distilled Large Language Model in Confidential Computing Environment for System-on-Chip Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16226v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in circuit design tasks and have typically undergone multiple rounds of training. Both the trained models and their associated training data are considered confidential intellectual property (IP) and must be protected from exposure. Confidential Computing offers a promising solution to protect data and models through Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). However, existing TEE implementations are not designed to support the resource-intensive nature of LLMs efficiently. In this work, we first present a comprehensive evaluation of the LLMs within a TEE-enabled confidential computing environment, specifically utilizing Intel Trust Domain Extensions (TDX). We constructed experiments on three environments: TEE-based, CPU-only, and CPU-GPU hybrid implementations, and evaluated their performance in terms of tokens per second. Our first observation is that distilled models, i.e., DeepSeek, surpass other models in performance due to their smaller parameters, making them suitable for resource-constrained devices. Also, in the quantized models such as 4-bit quantization (Q4) and 8-bit quantization (Q8), we observed a performance gain of up to 3x compared to FP16 models. Our findings indicate that for fewer parameter sets, such as DeepSeek-r1-1.5B, the TDX implementation outperforms the CPU version in executing computations within a secure environment. We further validate the results using a testbench designed for SoC design tasks. These validations demonstrate the potential of efficiently deploying lightweight LLMs on resource-constrained systems for semiconductor CAD applications.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures; |
| **[Careful Whisper: Attestation for peer-to-peer Confidential Computing networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14796v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are designed to protect the privacy and integrity of data in use. They enable secure data processing and sharing in peer-to-peer networks, such as vehicular ad hoc networks of autonomous vehicles, without compromising confidentiality. In these networks, nodes must establish mutual trust to collaborate securely. TEEs can achieve this through remote attestation, where a prover presents evidence of its trustworthiness to a verifier, which then decides whether or not to trust the prover. However, a naive peer-to-peer attestation approach, where every TEE directly attests every other TEE, results in quadratic communication overhead. This is inefficient in dynamic environments, where nodes frequently join and leave the network. To address this, we present Careful Whisper, a gossip-based protocol that disseminates trust efficiently, reducing attestation overhead to linear complexity under ideal conditions. It enables interoperability by enabling transitive trust across heterogeneous networks, and supports trust establishment with offline nodes via relayed attestations. Using a custom discrete-event simulator, we show that Careful Whisper propagates trust both faster and more widely than naive approaches across various network topologies. Our results demonstrate that our protocol is resource efficient, sending ~21.5 KiB and requiring 0.158 seconds per round in a 200-node network, and that our protocol is resilient to attestation failures across various network topologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[NVIDIA GPU Confidential Computing Demystified](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02770v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GPU Confidential Computing (GPU-CC) was introduced as part of the NVIDIA Hopper Architecture, extending the trust boundary beyond traditional CPU-based confidential computing. This innovation enables GPUs to securely process AI workloads, providing a robust and efficient solution for handling sensitive data. For end users, transitioning to GPU-CC mode is seamless, requiring no modifications to existing AI applications. However, this ease of adoption contrasts sharply with the complexity of the underlying proprietary systems. The lack of transparency presents significant challenges for security researchers seeking a deeper understanding of GPU-CC's architecture and operational mechanisms. The challenges of analyzing the NVIDIA GPU-CC system arise from a scarcity of detailed specifications, the proprietary nature of the ecosystem, and the complexity of product design. In this paper, we aim to demystify the implementation of NVIDIA GPU-CC system by piecing together the fragmented and incomplete information disclosed from various sources. Our investigation begins with a high-level discussion of the threat model and security principles before delving into the low-level details of each system component. We instrument the GPU kernel module -- the only open-source component of the system -- and conduct a series of experiments to identify the security weaknesses and potential exploits. For certain components that are out of reach through experiments, we propose well-reasoned speculations about their inner working mechanisms. We have responsibly reported all security findings presented in this paper to the NVIDIA PSIRT Team.</p></details> |  |
| **[NanoZone: Scalable, Efficient, and Secure Memory Protection for Arm CCA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07034v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Arm Confidential Computing Architecture (CCA) currently isolates at the granularity of an entire Confidential Virtual Machine (CVM), leaving intra-VM bugs such as Heartbleed unmitigated. The state-of-the-art narrows this to the process level, yet still cannot stop attacks that pivot within the same process, and prior intra-enclave schemes are either too slow or incompatible with CVM-style isolation. We extend CCA with a three-tier zone model that spawns an unlimited number of lightweight isolation domains inside a single process, while shielding them from kernel-space adversaries. To block domain-switch abuse, we also add a fast user-level Code-Pointer Integrity (CPI) mechanism. We developed two prototypes: a functional version on Arm's official simulator to validate resistance against intra-process and kernel-space adversaries, and a performance variant on Arm development boards evaluated for session-key isolation within server applications, in-memory key-value protection, and non-volatile-memory data isolation. NanoZone incurs roughly a 20% performance overhead while retaining 95% throughput compared to the system without fine-grained isolation.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenCCA: An Open Framework to Enable Arm CCA Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05129v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential computing has gained traction across major architectures with Intel TDX, AMD SEV-SNP, and Arm CCA. Unlike TDX and SEV-SNP, a key challenge in researching Arm CCA is the absence of hardware support, forcing researchers to develop ad-hoc performance prototypes on non-CCA Arm boards. This approach leads to duplicated efforts, inconsistent performance comparisons, and high barriers to entry. To address this, we present OpenCCA, an open research platform that enables the execution of CCA-bound code on commodity Armv8.2 hardware. By systematically adapting the software stack -- including bootloader, firmware, hypervisor, and kernel -- OpenCCA emulates CCA operations for performance evaluation while preserving functional correctness. We demonstrate its effectiveness with typical life-cycle measurements and case-studies inspired by prior CCA-based papers on a easily available Armv8.2 Rockchip board that costs $250.</p></details> |  |
| **[Performance of Confidential Computing GPUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16501v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work examines latency, throughput, and other metrics when performing inference on confidential GPUs. We explore different traffic patterns and scheduling strategies using a single Virtual Machine with one NVIDIA H100 GPU, to perform relaxed batch inferences on multiple Large Language Models (LLMs), operating under the constraint of swapping models in and out of memory, which necessitates efficient control. The experiments simulate diverse real-world scenarios by varying parameters such as traffic load, traffic distribution patterns, scheduling strategies, and Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements. The findings provide insights into the differences between confidential and non-confidential settings when performing inference in scenarios requiring active model swapping. Results indicate that in No-CC mode, relaxed batch inference with model swapping latency is 20-30% lower than in confidential mode. Additionally, SLA attainment is 15-20% higher in No-CC settings. Throughput in No-CC scenarios surpasses that of confidential mode by 45-70%, and GPU utilization is approximately 50% higher in No-CC environments. Overall, performance in the confidential setting is inferior to that in the No-CC scenario, primarily due to the additional encryption and decryption overhead required for loading models onto the GPU in confidential environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 tables.

| **[ACE: Confidential Computing for Embedded RISC-V Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12995v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential computing plays an important role in isolating sensitive applications from the vast amount of untrusted code commonly found in the modern cloud. We argue that it can also be leveraged to build safer and more secure mission-critical embedded systems. In this paper, we introduce the Assured Confidential Execution (ACE), an open-source and royalty-free confidential computing technology targeted for embedded RISC-V systems. We present a set of principles and a methodology that we used to build \ACE and that might be applied for developing other embedded systems that require formal verification. An evaluation of our prototype on the first available RISC-V hardware supporting virtualization indicates that ACE is a viable candidate for our target systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Privacy Risks and Protection in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01976v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly integral to diverse applications, their capabilities raise significant privacy concerns. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of privacy risks associated with LLMs and examines current solutions to mitigate these challenges. First, we analyze privacy leakage and attacks in LLMs, focusing on how these models unintentionally expose sensitive information through techniques such as model inversion, training data extraction, and membership inference. We investigate the mechanisms of privacy leakage, including the unauthorized extraction of training data and the potential exploitation of these vulnerabilities by malicious actors. Next, we review existing privacy protection against such risks, such as inference detection, federated learning, backdoor mitigation, and confidential computing, and assess their effectiveness in preventing privacy leakage. Furthermore, we highlight key practical challenges and propose future research directions to develop secure and privacy-preserving LLMs, emphasizing privacy risk assessment, secure knowledge transfer between models, and interdisciplinary frameworks for privacy governance. Ultimately, this survey aims to establish a roadmap for addressing escalating privacy challenges in the LLMs domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trusted Compute Units: A Framework for Chained Verifiable Computations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15717v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) facilitate decentralized computations across trust boundaries. However, ensuring complex computations with low gas fees and confidentiality remains challenging. Recent advances in Confidential Computing -- leveraging hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) -- and Proof-carrying Data -- employing cryptographic Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machines (zkVMs) -- hold promise for secure, privacy-preserving off-chain and layer-2 computations. On the other side, a homogeneous reliance on a single technology, such as TEEs or zkVMs, is impractical for decentralized environments with heterogeneous computational requirements. This paper introduces the Trusted Compute Unit (TCU), a unifying framework that enables composable and interoperable verifiable computations across heterogeneous technologies. Our approach allows decentralized applications (dApps) to flexibly offload complex computations to TCUs, obtaining proof of correctness. These proofs can be anchored on-chain for automated dApp interactions, while ensuring confidentiality of input data, and integrity of output data. We demonstrate how TCUs can support a prominent blockchain use case, such as federated learning. By enabling secure off-chain interactions without incurring on-chain confirmation delays or gas fees, TCUs significantly improve system performance and scalability. Experimental insights and performance evaluations confirm the feasibility and practicality of this unified approach, advancing the state of the art in verifiable off-chain services for the blockchain ecosystem.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in 2025 IEEE International Conference on Blockchain and Cryptocurrency (ICBC'25). 9 pages. 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[An Early Experience with Confidential Computing Architecture for On-Device Model Protection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08508v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying machine learning (ML) models on user devices can improve privacy (by keeping data local) and reduce inference latency. Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are a practical solution for protecting proprietary models, yet existing TEE solutions have architectural constraints that hinder on-device model deployment. Arm Confidential Computing Architecture (CCA), a new Arm extension, addresses several of these limitations and shows promise as a secure platform for on-device ML. In this paper, we evaluate the performance-privacy trade-offs of deploying models within CCA, highlighting its potential to enable confidential and efficient ML applications. Our evaluations show that CCA can achieve an overhead of, at most, 22% in running models of different sizes and applications, including image classification, voice recognition, and chat assistants. This performance overhead comes with privacy benefits; for example, our framework can successfully protect the model against membership inference attack by an 8.3% reduction in the adversary's success rate. To support further research and early adoption, we make our code and methodology publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 8th Workshop on System Software for Trusted Execution (SysTEX 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Transparent Attested DNS for Confidential Computing Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14611v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential services running in hardware-protected Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) can provide higher security assurance, but this requires custom clients and protocols to distribute, update, and verify their attestation evidence. Compared with classic Internet security, built upon universal abstractions such as domain names, origins, and certificates, this puts a significant burden on service users and providers. In particular, Web browsers and other legacy clients do not get the same security guaranties as custom clients. We present a new approach for users to establish trust in confidential services. We propose attested DNS (aDNS): a name service that securely binds the attested implementation of confidential services to their domain names. ADNS enforces policies for all names in its zone of authority: any TEE that runs a service must present hardware attestation that complies with the domain-specific policy before registering keys and obtaining certificates for any name in this domain. ADNS provides protocols for zone delegation, TEE registration, and certificate issuance. ADNS builds on standards such as DNSSEC, DANE, ACME and Certificate Transparency. ADNS provides DNS transparency by keeping all records, policies, and attestations in a public append-only log, thereby enabling auditing and preventing targeted attacks. We implement aDNS as a confidential service using a fault-tolerant network of TEEs. We evaluate it using sample confidential services that illustrate various TEE platforms. On the client side, we provide a generic browser extension that queries and verifies attestation records before opening TLS connections, with negligible performance overhead, and we show that, with aDNS, even legacy Web clients benefit from confidential computing as long as some enlightened clients verify attestations to deter or blame malicious actors.</p></details> |  |
| **[TFHE-Coder: Evaluating LLM-agentic Fully Homomorphic Encryption Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12217v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the torus (TFHE) enables computation on encrypted data without decryption, making it a cornerstone of secure and confidential computing. Despite its potential in privacy preserving machine learning, secure multi party computation, private blockchain transactions, and secure medical diagnostics, its adoption remains limited due to cryptographic complexity and usability challenges. While various TFHE libraries and compilers exist, practical code generation remains a hurdle. We propose a compiler integrated framework to evaluate LLM inference and agentic optimization for TFHE code generation, focusing on logic gates and ReLU activation. Our methodology assesses error rates, compilability, and structural similarity across open and closedsource LLMs. Results highlight significant limitations in off-the-shelf models, while agentic optimizations such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and few-shot prompting reduce errors and enhance code fidelity. This work establishes the first benchmark for TFHE code generation, demonstrating how LLMs, when augmented with domain-specific feedback, can bridge the expertise gap in FHE code generation.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[SoK: A cloudy view on trust relationships of CVMs -- How Confidential Virtual Machines are falling short in Public Cloud](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08256v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential computing in the public cloud intends to safeguard workload privacy while outsourcing infrastructure management to a cloud provider. This is achieved by executing customer workloads within so called Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), such as Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs), which protect them from unauthorized access by cloud administrators and privileged system software. At the core of confidential computing lies remote attestation -- a mechanism that enables workload owners to verify the initial state of their workload and furthermore authenticate the underlying hardware. hile this represents a significant advancement in cloud security, this SoK critically examines the confidential computing offerings of market-leading cloud providers to assess whether they genuinely adhere to its core principles. We develop a taxonomy based on carefully selected criteria to systematically evaluate these offerings, enabling us to analyse the components responsible for remote attestation, the evidence provided at each stage, the extent of cloud provider influence and whether this undermines the threat model of confidential computing. Specifically, we investigate how CVMs are deployed in the public cloud infrastructures, the extent to which customers can request and verify attestation evidence, and their ability to define and enforce configuration and attestation requirements. This analysis provides insight into whether confidential computing guarantees -- namely confidentiality and integrity -- are genuinely upheld. Our findings reveal that all major cloud providers retain control over critical parts of the trusted software stack and, in some cases, intervene in the standard remote attestation process. This directly contradicts their claims of delivering confidential computing, as the model fundamentally excludes the cloud provider from the set of trusted entities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training Differentially Private Models with Secure Multiparty Computation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02625v4)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of learning a machine learning model from training data that originates at multiple data owners while providing formal privacy guarantees regarding the protection of each owner's data. Existing solutions based on Differential Privacy (DP) achieve this at the cost of a drop in accuracy. Solutions based on Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) do not incur such accuracy loss but leak information when the trained model is made publicly available. We propose an MPC solution for training DP models. Our solution relies on an MPC protocol for model training, and an MPC protocol for perturbing the trained model coefficients with Laplace noise in a privacy-preserving manner. The resulting MPC+DP approach achieves higher accuracy than a pure DP approach while providing the same formal privacy guarantees. Our work obtained first place in the iDASH2021 Track III competition on confidential computing for secure genome analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Locking Machine Learning Models into Hardware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20990v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern machine learning (ML) models are expensive IP and business competitiveness often depends on keeping this IP confidential. This in turn restricts how these models are deployed; for example, it is unclear how to deploy a model on-device without inevitably leaking the underlying model. At the same time, confidential computing technologies such as multi-party computation or homomorphic encryption remain impractical for wide adoption. In this paper, we take a different approach and investigate the feasibility of ML-specific mechanisms that deter unauthorized model use by restricting the model to only be usable on specific hardware, making adoption on unauthorized hardware inconvenient. That way, even if IP is compromised, it cannot be trivially used without specialised hardware or major model adjustment. In a sense, we seek to enable cheap \emph{locking of machine learning models into specific hardware}. We demonstrate that \emph{locking} mechanisms are feasible by either targeting efficiency of model representations, making such models incompatible with quantization, or tying the model's operation to specific characteristics of hardware, such as the number of clock cycles for arithmetic operations. We demonstrate that locking comes with negligible overheads, while significantly restricting usability of the resultant model on unauthorized hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures of main text; 9 pages, 12 figures of appendices</p></details> |
| **[Laminator: Verifiable ML Property Cards using Hardware-assisted Attestations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17548v3)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Regulations increasingly call for various assurances from machine learning (ML) model providers about their training data, training process, and model behavior. For better transparency, industry (e.g., Huggingface and Google) has adopted model cards and datasheets to describe various properties of training datasets and models. In the same vein, we introduce the notion of inference cards to describe the properties of a given inference (e.g., binding of the output to the model and its corresponding input). We coin the term ML property cards to collectively refer to these various types of cards. To prevent a malicious model provider from including false information in ML property cards, they need to be verifiable. We show how to construct verifiable ML property cards using property attestation, technical mechanisms by which a prover (e.g., a model provider) can attest to various ML properties to a verifier (e.g., an auditor). Since prior attestation mechanisms based purely on cryptography are often narrowly focused (lacking versatility) and inefficient, we need an efficient mechanism to attest different types of properties across the entire ML model pipeline. Emerging widespread support for confidential computing has made it possible to run and even train models inside hardware-assisted trusted execution environments (TEEs), which provide highly efficient attestation mechanisms. We propose Laminator, which uses TEEs to provide the first framework for verifiable ML property cards via hardware-assisted ML property attestations. Laminator is efficient in terms of overhead, scalable to large numbers of verifiers, and versatile with respect to the properties it can prove during training or inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM C...</summary><p>ACM Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy (CODASPY), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating the Performance of the DeepSeek Model in Confidential Computing Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11347v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in cloud environments raises critical security concerns, particularly regarding model confidentiality and data privacy. Confidential computing, enabled by Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), offers a promising solution to mitigate these risks. However, existing TEE implementations, primarily CPU-based, struggle to efficiently support the resource-intensive nature of LLM inference and training. In this work, we present the first evaluation of the DeepSeek model within a TEE-enabled confidential computing environment, specifically utilizing Intel Trust Domain Extensions (TDX). Our study benchmarks DeepSeek's performance across CPU-only, CPU-GPU hybrid, and TEE-based implementations. For smaller parameter sets, such as DeepSeek-R1-1.5B, the TDX implementation outperforms the CPU version in executing computations within a secure environment. It highlights the potential for efficiently deploying LLM models on resource-constrained systems while ensuring security. The overall GPU-to-CPU performance ratio averages 12 across different model sizes, with smaller models exhibiting a lower ratio. Additionally, we provide foundational insights and guidance on optimizing CPU-GPU confidential computing solutions for scalable and secure AI deployments. Our findings contribute to the advancement of privacy-preserving AI, paving the way for efficient and secure LLM inference in confidential computing environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatic ISA analysis for Secure Context Switching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06609v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction set architectures are complex, with hundreds of registers and instructions that can modify dozens of them during execution, variably on each instance. Prose-style ISA specifications struggle to capture these intricacies of the ISAs, where often the important details about a single register are spread out across hundreds of pages of documentation. Ensuring that all ISA-state is swapped in context switch implementations of privileged software requires meticulous examination of these pages. This manual process is tedious and error-prone. We propose a tool called Sailor that leverages machine-readable ISA specifications written in Sail to automate this task. Sailor determines the ISA-state necessary to swap during the context switch using the data collected from Sail and a novel algorithm to classify ISA-state as security-sensitive. Using Sailor's output, we identify three different classes of mishandled ISA-state across four open-source confidential computing systems. We further reveal five distinct security vulnerabilities that can be exploited using the mishandled ISA-state. This research exposes an often overlooked attack surface that stems from mishandled ISA-state, enabling unprivileged adversaries to exploit system vulnerabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, 4 listings</p></details> |

Motivated by the pervasive reliance on single service providers for data storage and computation, we propose a privacy-preserving scheme that achieves information-theoretic security guarantees for computing polynomials over non-uniform data distributions. Our framework builds upon the concept of perfect subset privacy and employs linear hashing techniques to transform non-uniform data into approximately uniform distributions, enabling robust and secure computation. We derive leakage bounds and demonstrate that information leakage of any subset of user data to untrusted service providers, i.e., not only to colluding workers but also (and more importantly) to the admin, remains negligible under the proposed scheme.</p></details> | <details><summary>Parts...</summary><p>Parts of this work were submitted to ISIT 2025</p></details> |

However, FL introduces the need for additional security measures as FL alone is still subject to vulnerabilities such as model and data poisoning and inference attacks. Confidential Computing (CC) is a paradigm that, by leveraging hardware-based trusted execution environments (TEEs), protects the confidentiality and integrity of ML models and data, thus resulting in a powerful ally of FL applications. Typical TEEs offer an application-isolation level but suffer many drawbacks, such as limited available memory and debugging and coding difficulties. The new generation of TEEs offers a virtual machine (VM)-based isolation level, thus reducing the porting effort for existing applications. In this work, we compare the performance of VM-based and application-isolation level TEEs for confidential FL (CFL) applications. In particular, we evaluate the impact of TEEs and additional security mechanisms such as TLS (for securing the communication channel). The results, obtained across three datasets and two deep learning models, demonstrate that the new VM-based TEEs introduce a limited overhead (at most 1.5x), thus paving the way to leverage public and untrusted computing environments, such as HPC facilities or public cloud, without detriment to performance.</p></details> |  |

Hereby, the finetuning is conducted offsite, i.e., on the computation infrastructure of a third-party cloud provider. We tackle this problem by proposing ObfuscaTune, a novel, efficient and fully utility-preserving approach that combines a simple yet effective obfuscation technique with an efficient usage of confidential computing (only 5% of the model parameters are placed on TEE). We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of ObfuscaTune by validating it on GPT-2 models with different sizes on four NLP benchmark datasets. Finally, we compare to a na\"ive version of our approach to highlight the necessity of using random matrices with low condition numbers in our approach to reduce errors induced by the obfuscation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2025 (PPAI Workshop)</p></details> |

In this work, we develop the first, comprehensive symbolic model of the software interface of the latest SEV iteration called SEV Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP). Our model covers remote attestation, key derivation, page swap and live migration. We analyze the security of the software interface of SEV-SNP and formally prove that most critical secrecy, authentication, attestation and freshness properties do indeed hold in the model. Furthermore, we find that the platform-agnostic nature of messages exchanged between SNP guests and the AMD Secure Processor firmware presents a potential weakness in the design. We show how this weakness leads to formal attacks on multiple security properties, including the partial compromise of attestation report integrity, and discuss possible impacts and mitigations.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

However, existing PCHs, often preplaced without considering payment request distribution across PCNs, can lead to load imbalance. PCNs' reliance on source routing, which makes decisions based solely on individual sender requests, can degrade performance by overlooking other requests, thus further impairing scalability. In this paper, we introduce Splicer$^{+}$, a highly scalable multi-PCH solution based on the trusted execution environment (TEE). We study tradeoffs in communication overhead between participants, transform the original NP-hard PCH placement problem by mixed-integer linear programming, and propose optimal/approximate solutions with load balancing for different PCN scales using supermodular techniques. Considering global PCN states and local directly connected sender requests, we design a deadlock-free routing protocol for PCHs. It dynamically adjusts the payment processing rate across multiple channels and, combined with TEE, ensures high-performance routing with confidential computation. We provide a formal security proof for the Splicer$^{+}$ protocol in the UC-framework. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of Splicer$^{+}$, with transaction success ratio ($\uparrow$51.1%), throughput ($\uparrow$181.5%), and latency outperforming state-of-the-art PCNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of ICDCS 2023 (arXiv:2305.19182)</p></details> |

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has quickly become a feasible solution for organizations looking to overcome the challenges of maintaining proprietary models and to help reduce LLM hallucinations in their query responses. However, RAG comes with its own issues regarding scaling data pipelines across tiered-access and disparate data sources. In many scenarios, it is necessary to query beyond a single data silo to provide richer and more relevant context for an LLM. Analyzing data sources within and across organizational trust boundaries is often limited by complex data-sharing policies that prohibit centralized data storage, therefore, inhibit the fast and effective setup and scaling of RAG solutions. In this paper, we introduce Confidential Computing (CC) techniques as a solution for secure Federated Retrieval Augmented Generation (FedRAG). Our proposed Confidential FedRAG system (C-FedRAG) enables secure connection and scaling of a RAG workflows across a decentralized network of data providers by ensuring context confidentiality. We also demonstrate how to implement a C-FedRAG system using the NVIDIA FLARE SDK and assess its performance using the MedRAG toolkit and MIRAGE benchmarking dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[CCxTrust: Confidential Computing Platform Based on TEE and TPM Collaborative Trust](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03842v3)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential Computing has emerged to address data security challenges in cloud-centric deployments by protecting data in use through hardware-level isolation. However, reliance on a single hardware root of trust (RoT) limits user confidence in cloud platforms, especially for high-performance AI services, where end-to-end protection of sensitive models and data is critical. Furthermore, the lack of interoperability and a unified trust model in multi-cloud environments prevents the establishment of a cross-platform, cross-cloud chain of trust, creating a significant trust gap for users with high privacy requirements. To address the challenges mentioned above, this paper proposes CCxTrust (Confidential Computing with Trust), a confidential computing platform leveraging collaborative roots of trust from TEE and TPM. CCxTrust combines the black-box RoT embedded in the CPU-TEE with the flexible white-box RoT of TPM to establish a collaborative trust framework. The platform implements independent Roots of Trust for Measurement (RTM) for TEE and TPM, and a collaborative Root of Trust for Report (RTR) for composite attestation. The Root of Trust for Storage (RTS) is solely supported by TPM. We also present the design and implementation of a confidential TPM supporting multiple modes for secure use within confidential virtual machines. Additionally, we propose a composite attestation protocol integrating TEE and TPM to enhance security and attestation efficiency, which is proven secure under the PCL protocol security model. We implemented a prototype of CCxTrust on a confidential computing server with AMD SEV-SNP and TPM chips, requiring minimal modifications to the TPM and guest Linux kernel. The composite attestation efficiency improved by 24% without significant overhead, while Confidential TPM performance showed a 16.47% reduction compared to standard TPM.</p></details> | 23 pages, 14 figures |
| **[A Confidential Computing Transparency Framework for a Comprehensive Trust Chain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03720v2)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential Computing enhances privacy of data in-use through hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) that use attestation to verify their integrity, authenticity, and certain runtime properties, along with those of the binaries they execute. However, TEEs require user trust, as attestation alone cannot guarantee the absence of vulnerabilities or backdoors. Enhanced transparency can mitigate the reliance on naive trust. Some organisations currently employ various transparency measures, including open-source firmware, publishing technical documentation, or undergoing external audits, but these require investments with unclear returns. This may discourage the adoption of transparency, leaving users with limited visibility into system privacy measures. Additionally, the lack of standardisation complicates meaningful comparisons between implementations. To address these challenges, we propose a three-level conceptual framework providing organisations with a practical pathway to incrementally improve Confidential Computing transparency. To evaluate whether our transparency framework contributes to an increase in end-user trust, we conducted an empirical study with over 800 non-expert participants. The results indicate that greater transparency improves user comfort, with participants willing to share various types of personal data across different levels of transparency. The study also reveals misconceptions about transparency, highlighting the need for clear communication and user education.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blindfold: Confidential Memory Management by Untrusted Operating System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01059v3)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential Computing (CC) has received increasing attention in recent years as a mechanism to protect user data from untrusted operating systems (OSes). Existing CC solutions hide confidential memory from the OS and/or encrypt it to achieve confidentiality. In doing so, they render OS memory optimization unusable or complicate the trusted computing base (TCB) required for optimization. This paper presents our results toward overcoming these limitations, synthesized in a CC design named Blindfold. Like many other CC solutions, Blindfold relies on a small trusted software component running at a higher privilege level than the kernel, called Guardian. It features three techniques that can enhance existing CC solutions. First, instead of nesting page tables, Guardian mediates how the OS accesses memory and handles exceptions by switching page and interrupt tables. Second, Blindfold employs a lightweight capability system to regulate the kernel semantic access to user memory, unifying case-by-case approaches in previous work. Finally, Blindfold provides carefully designed secure ABI for confidential memory management without encryption. We report an implementation of Blindfold that works on ARMv8-A/Linux. Using Blindfold prototype, we are able to evaluate the cost of enabling confidential memory management by the untrusted Linux kernel. We show Blindfold has a smaller runtime TCB than related systems and enjoys competitive performance. More importantly, we show that the Linux kernel, including all of its memory optimizations except memory compression, can function properly for confidential memory. This requires only about 400 lines of kernel modifications.</p></details> |  |

Indeed, many hail the combination of TEEs and blockchains a good "marriage": TEEs bring confidential computing to the blockchain while the consensus layer could help defend TEEs from forking attacks. In this paper, we systemize how current blockchain solutions integrate TEEs and to what extent they are secure against forking attacks. To do so, we thoroughly analyze 29 proposals for TEE-based blockchains, ranging from academic proposals to production-ready platforms. We uncover a lack of consensus in the community on how to combine TEEs and blockchains. In particular, we identify four broad means to interconnect TEEs with consensus, analyze their limitations, and discuss possible remedies. Our analysis also reveals previously undocumented forking attacks on three production-ready TEE-based blockchains: Ten, Phala, and the Secret Network. We leverage our analysis to propose effective countermeasures against those vulnerabilities; we responsibly disclosed our findings to the developers of each affected platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 14 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

This paper introduces RISecure-PUF, a security extension utilizing existing Physical Unclonable Functions for key generation and secure protocol purposes. A one-way hash function is integrated to ensure provable security against modeling attacks, while a lookaside buffer accelerates batch sampling and minimizes reliance on error correction codes. Implemented on the Genesys 2 FPGA, RISecure-PUF improves at least $2.72\times$ in batch scenarios with negligible hardware overhead and a maximum performance reduction of $10.7\%$, enabled by reusing the hash function module in integrated environments such as cryptographic engines.</p></details> |  |

We benchmark the overhead introduced by TEE mode across various LLMs and token lengths, with a particular focus on the bottleneck caused by CPU-GPU data transfers via PCIe. Our results indicate that while there is minimal computational overhead within the GPU, the overall performance penalty is primarily attributable to data transfer. For the majority of typical LLM queries, the overhead remains below 7%, with larger models and longer sequences experiencing nearly zero overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[PipeLLM: Fast and Confidential Large Language Model Services with Speculative Pipelined Encryption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03357v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential computing on GPUs, like NVIDIA H100, mitigates the security risks of outsourced Large Language Models (LLMs) by implementing strong isolation and data encryption. Nonetheless, this encryption incurs a significant performance overhead, reaching up to 52.8 percent and 88.2 percent throughput drop when serving OPT-30B and OPT-66B, respectively. To address this challenge, we introduce PipeLLM, a user-transparent runtime system. PipeLLM removes the overhead by overlapping the encryption and GPU computation through pipelining - an idea inspired by the CPU instruction pipelining - thereby effectively concealing the latency increase caused by encryption. The primary technical challenge is that, unlike CPUs, the encryption module lacks prior knowledge of the specific data needing encryption until it is requested by the GPUs. To this end, we propose speculative pipelined encryption to predict the data requiring encryption by analyzing the serving patterns of LLMs. Further, we have developed an efficient, low-cost pipeline relinquishing approach for instances of incorrect predictions. Our experiments on NVIDIA H100 GPU show that compared with vanilla systems without confidential computing (e.g., vLLM, PEFT, and FlexGen), PipeLLM incurs modest overhead (less than 19.6 percent in throughput) across various LLM sizes, from 13B to 175B.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ASPLOS 2025</p></details> |

Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) offer a promising solution by creating secure environments that protect data and code from such threats. The rise of confidential computing on cloud platforms facilitates the deployment of TEE-enabled server applications, which are expected to be widely adopted in web services such as privacy-preserving LLM inference and secure data logging. One key feature is Remote Attestation (RA), which enables integrity verification of a TEE. However, $\textit{compatibility}$ issues with RA verification arise as no browsers natively support this feature, making prior solutions cumbersome and risky. To address these challenges, we propose $\texttt{RA-WEBs}$ ($\textbf{R}$emote $\textbf{A}$ttestation for $\textbf{Web}$ $\textbf{s}$ervices), a novel RA protocol designed for high compatibility with the current web ecosystem. $\texttt{RA-WEBs}$ leverages established web mechanisms for immediate deployability, enabling RA verification on existing browsers. We conduct a comprehensive security analysis, demonstrating $\texttt{RA-WEBs}$'s resilience against various threats. Our contributions include the $\texttt{RA-WEBs}$ proposal, a proof-of-concept implementation, an in-depth security analysis, and publicly available code for reproducible research.</p></details> |  |

Decentralized AI distributes AI services among multiple entities without centralized oversight, fostering transparency and robustness. However, this structure introduces significant privacy challenges, as sensitive assets such as proprietary models and personal data may be exposed to untrusted participants. Cryptography-based privacy protection techniques such as zero-knowledge machine learning (zkML) suffers prohibitive computational overhead. To address the limitation, we propose leveraging Confidential Computing (CC). Confidential Computing leverages hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to provide isolation for processing sensitive data, ensuring that both model parameters and user data remain secure, even in decentralized, potentially untrusted environments. While TEEs face a few limitations, we believe they can bridge the privacy gap in decentralized AI. We explore how we can integrate TEEs into Atoma's decentralized framework.</p></details> |  |

Although CVMs have been widely adopted by major cloud service providers, current CVM designs face significant challenges in runtime resource management due to their fixed capacities and lack of transparency. These limitations hamper efficient cloud resource management, leading to increased operational costs and reduced agility in responding to fluctuating workloads. This paper introduces a dynamic CPU resource management approach, featuring the novel concept of "Elastic CVM. This approach allows for hypervisor-assisted runtime adjustment of CPU resources using a specialized vCPU type, termed Worker vCPU. This new approach enhances CPU resource adaptability and operational efficiency without compromising security. Additionally, we introduce a Worker vCPU Abstraction Layer to simplify Worker vCPU deployment and management. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we have designed and implemented a serverless computing prototype platform, called Ditto. We show that Ditto significantly improves performance and efficiency through finergrain resource management. The concept of "Elastic CVM" and the Worker vCPU design not only optimize cloud resource utilization but also pave the way for more flexible and cost-effective confidential computing environments.</p></details> |  |

However, managing heterogeneous and intermittent resources to support machine/deep learning (ML/DL) based workflows poses challenges in resource governance for reliability, and confidentiality for model/data privacy protection. There is a need for approaches to handle the volatility of volunteer edge node availability, and also to scale the confidential data-intensive workflow execution across a large number of VEC nodes. In this paper, we present VECA, a reliable and confidential VEC resource clustering solution featuring three-fold methods tailored for executing ML/DL-based scientific workflows on VEC resources. Firstly, a capacity-based clustering approach enhances system reliability and minimizes VEC node search latency. Secondly, a novel two-phase, globally distributed scheduling scheme optimizes job allocation based on node attributes and using time-series-based Recurrent Neural Networks. Lastly, the integration of confidential computing ensures privacy preservation of the scientific workflows, where model and data information are not shared with VEC resources providers. We evaluate VECA in a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) cloud testbed that features OpenFaaS and MicroK8S to support two ML/DL-based scientific workflows viz., G2P-Deep (bioinformatics) and PAS-ML (health informatics). Results from tested experiments demonstrate that our proposed VECA approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods; especially VECA exhibits a two-fold reduction in VEC node search latency and over 20% improvement in productivity rates following execution failures compared to the next best method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted - IC2E 2024 Conference</p></details> |

The combination of CPU and GPU is particularly popular due to its versatility. However, these heterogeneous systems face significant security and privacy risks. Advances in privacy-preserving techniques, especially hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), offer effective protection for GPU applications. Nonetheless, the potential security risks involved in extending TEEs to GPUs in heterogeneous systems remain uncertain and need further investigation. To investigate these risks in depth, we study the existing popular GPU TEE designs and summarize and compare their key implications. Additionally, we review existing powerful attacks on GPUs and traditional TEEs deployed on CPUs, along with the efforts to mitigate these threats. We identify potential attack surfaces introduced by GPU TEEs and provide insights into key considerations for designing secure GPU TEEs. This survey is timely as new TEEs for heterogeneous systems, particularly GPUs, are being developed, highlighting the need to understand potential security threats and build both efficient and secure systems.</p></details> | 35 pages, 7 figures |

While significantly improving the performance of the mobile applications, the cloud-based mechanism often causes privacy concerns as the multimedia data and services are offloaded from the trusted user device to untrusted cloud servers. Several recent studies have proposed perturbation-based privacy preserving mechanisms, which obfuscate the offloaded multimedia data to eliminate privacy exposures without affecting the functionality of the remote multimedia services. However, the existing privacy protection approaches require the deployment of computation-intensive perturbation generation on the resource-constrained mobile devices. Also, the obfuscated images are typically not compliant with the standard image compression algorithms and suffer from significant bandwidth consumption. In this paper, we develop a novel privacy-preserving multimedia mobile cloud computing framework, namely $PMC^2$, to address the resource and bandwidth challenges. $PMC^2$ employs secure confidential computing in the cloud to deploy the perturbation generator, which addresses the resource challenge while maintaining the privacy. Furthermore, we develop a neural compressor specifically trained to compress the perturbed images in order to address the bandwidth challenge. We implement $PMC^2$ in an end-to-end mobile cloud computing system, based on which our evaluations demonstrate superior latency, power efficiency, and bandwidth consumption achieved by $PMC^2$ while maintaining high accuracy in the target multimedia service.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present Devlore which allows realm VMs to directly access integrated peripherals. Devlore memory isolation re-purposes CCA hardware primitives (granule protection and stage-two page tables), while our interrupt isolation adapts a delegate-but-check strategy. Our choice of offloading interrupt management to the hypervisor but adding correctness checks in the trusted software allows Devlore to preserve compatibility and performance. We evaluate Devlore on Arm FVP to demonstrate 5 diverse peripherals attached to realm VMs.</p></details> |  |

TrustZone allows any secure world code to access the normal world that runs Android. Similarly, a trusted hypervisor has full access to Android running in one VM and security services in other VMs. In this paper, we motivate the need for mutual isolation, wherein Android, hypervisors, and the secure world are isolated from each other. Then, we propose a sandboxed service abstraction, such that a sandboxed execution cannot access any other sandbox, Android, hypervisor, or secure world memory. We present Aster which achieves these goals while ensuring that sandboxed execution can still communicate with Android to get inputs and provide outputs securely. Our main insight is to leverage the hardware isolation offered by Arm Confidential Computing Architecture (CCA). However, since CCA does not satisfy our sandboxing and mutual isolation requirements, Aster repurposes its hardware enforcement to meet its goals while addressing challenges such as secure interfaces, virtio, and protection against interrupts. We implement Aster to demonstrate its feasibility and assess its compatibility. We take three case studies, including one currently deployed on Android phones and insufficiently secured using a trusted hypervisor, to demonstrate that they can be protected by Aster.</p></details> |  |

Its journey typically flows from collection to transport, storage, management and processing. While best practices and regulations guide data management and protection, recent events have underscored its vulnerability. Academic research and commercial data handling have been marred by scandals, revealing the brittleness of data management. Data, despite its importance, is susceptible to undue disclosures, leaks, losses, manipulation, or fabrication. These incidents often occur without visibility or accountability, necessitating a systematic structure for safe, honest, and auditable data management. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Honest Computing as the practice and approach that emphasizes transparency, integrity, and ethical behaviour within the realm of computing and technology. It ensures that computer systems and software operate honestly and reliably without hidden agendas, biases, or unethical practices. It enables privacy and confidentiality of data and code by design and by default. We also introduce a reference framework to achieve demonstrable data lineage and provenance, contrasting it with Secure Computing, a related but differently-orientated form of computing. At its core, Honest Computing leverages Trustless Computing, Confidential Computing, Distributed Computing, Cryptography and AAA security concepts. Honest Computing opens new ways of creating technology-based processes and workflows which permit the migration of regulatory frameworks for data protection from principle-based approaches to rule-based ones. Addressing use cases in many fields, from AI model protection and ethical layering to digital currency formation for finance and banking, trading, and healthcare, this foundational layer approach can help define new standards for appropriate data custody and processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Data & Policy journal</p></details> |

However, CVMs often come with large and vulnerable operating system kernels, making them susceptible to attacks exploiting kernel weaknesses. The imprecise control over the read/write access in the page table has allowed attackers to exploit vulnerabilities. The lack of security hierarchy leads to insufficient separation between untrusted applications and guest OS, making the kernel susceptible to direct threats from untrusted programs. This study proposes Cabin, an isolated execution framework within guest VM utilizing the latest AMD SEV-SNP technology. Cabin shields untrusted processes to the user space of a lower virtual machine privilege level (VMPL) by introducing a proxy-kernel between the confined processes and the guest OS. Furthermore, we propose execution protection mechanisms based on fine-gained control of VMPL privilege for vulnerable programs and the proxy-kernel to minimize the attack surface. We introduce asynchronous forwarding mechanism and anonymous memory management to reduce the performance impact. The evaluation results show that the Cabin framework incurs a modest overhead (5% on average) on Nbench and WolfSSL benchmarks.</p></details> | ICICS 2024 |
| **[Ascend-CC: Confidential Computing on Heterogeneous NPU for Emerging Generative AI Workloads](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11888v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud workloads have dominated generative AI based on large language models (LLM). Specialized hardware accelerators, such as GPUs, NPUs, and TPUs, play a key role in AI adoption due to their superior performance over general-purpose CPUs. The AI models and the data are often highly sensitive and come from mutually distrusting parties. Existing CPU-based TEEs such as Intel SGX or AMD SEV do not provide sufficient protection. Device-centric TEEs like Nvidia-CC only address tightly coupled CPU-GPU systems with a proprietary solution requiring TEE on the host CPU side. On the other hand, existing academic proposals are tailored toward specific CPU-TEE platforms. To address this gap, we propose Ascend-CC, a confidential computing architecture based on discrete NPU devices that requires no trust in the host system. Ascend-CC provides strong security by ensuring data and model encryption that protects not only the data but also the model parameters and operator binaries. Ascend-CC uses delegation-based memory semantics to ensure isolation from the host software stack, and task attestation provides strong model integrity guarantees. Our Ascend-CC implementation and evaluation with state-of-the-art LLMs such as Llama2 and Llama3 shows that Ascend-CC introduces minimal overhead with no changes in the AI software stack.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enabling Performant and Secure EDA as a Service in Public Clouds Using Confidential Containers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06040v1)** | 2024-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Increasingly, business opportunities available to fabless design teams in the semiconductor industry far exceed those addressable with on-prem compute resources. An attractive option to capture these electronic design automation (EDA) design opportunities is through public cloud bursting. However, security concerns with public cloud bursting arise from having to protect process design kits, third party intellectual property, and new design data for semiconductor devices and chips. One way to address security concerns for public cloud bursting is to leverage confidential containers for EDA workloads. Confidential containers add zero trust computing elements to significantly reduce the probability of intellectual property escapes. A key concern that often follows security discussions is whether EDA workload performance will suffer with confidential computing. In this work we demonstrate a full set of EDA confidential containers and their deployment and characterize performance impacts of confidential elements of the flow including storage and networking. A complete end-to-end confidential container-based EDA workload exhibits 7.13% and 2.05% performance overheads over bare-metal container and VM based solutions, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, recent work has pointed out that the majority of the open source benchmarks available today have been contaminated or leaked into LLMs, meaning that LLMs have access to test data during pretraining and/or fine-tuning. This raises serious concerns about the validity of benchmarking studies conducted so far and the future of evaluation using benchmarks. To solve this problem, we propose Private Benchmarking, a solution where test datasets are kept private and models are evaluated without revealing the test data to the model. We describe various scenarios (depending on the trust placed on model owners or dataset owners), and present solutions to avoid data contamination using private benchmarking. For scenarios where the model weights need to be kept private, we describe solutions from confidential computing and cryptography that can aid in private benchmarking. We build an end-to-end system, TRUCE, that enables such private benchmarking showing that the overheads introduced to protect models and benchmark are negligible (in the case of confidential computing) and tractable (when cryptographic security is required). Finally, we also discuss solutions to the problem of benchmark dataset auditing, to ensure that private benchmarks are of sufficiently high quality.</p></details> |  |

Previous work applies formal techniques to verify the specification and prototype reference implementation of RMM. However, relying solely on a single verification tool may lead to the oversight of certain bugs or vulnerabilities. This paper discusses the application of ESBMC, a state-of-the-art Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)-based software model checker, to further enhance RRM verification. We demonstrate ESBMC's ability to precisely parse the source code and identify specification failures within a reasonable time frame. Moreover, we propose potential improvements for ESBMC to enhance its efficiency for industry engineers. This work contributes to exploring the capabilities of formal verification techniques in real-world scenarios and suggests avenues for further improvements to better meet industrial verification needs.</p></details> |  |

As a mature system-oriented approach, Confidential Computing has been utilized in both academia and industry to mitigate privacy and security issues in various ML scenarios. In this paper, the conjunction between ML and Confidential Computing is investigated. We systematize the prior work on Confidential Computing-assisted ML techniques that provide i) confidentiality guarantees and ii) integrity assurances, and discuss their advanced features and drawbacks. Key challenges are further identified, and we provide dedicated analyses of the limitations in existing Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) systems for ML use cases. Finally, prospective works are discussed, including grounded privacy definitions for closed-loop protection, partitioned executions of efficient ML, dedicated TEE-assisted designs for ML, TEE-aware ML, and ML full pipeline guarantees. By providing these potential solutions in our systematization of knowledge, we aim to build the bridge to help achieve a much stronger TEE-enabled ML for privacy guarantees without introducing computation and system costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Surve...</summary><p>Survey paper, 37 pages, accepted to ACM Computing Surveys</p></details> |

One finding is that the "performance tax" for such confidential analytical processing is acceptable compared to not using these technologies. We eventually manage to run TPC-H SF30 with under 2x overhead compared to non-encrypted, non-enclave execution; we show that, specifically, columnar compression and encryption are a good combination. Our second finding consists of dos and don'ts to tune DuckDB to work effectively in this environment. There are various performance hazards: potentially 5x higher cache miss costs due to memory encryption inside the enclave, NUMA penalties, and highly elevated cost of swapping pages in and out of the enclave -- which is also triggered indirectly by using a non-SGX-aware malloc library.</p></details> |  |
| **[GuaranTEE: Towards Attestable and Private ML with CCA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00190v1)** | 2024-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine-learning (ML) models are increasingly being deployed on edge devices to provide a variety of services. However, their deployment is accompanied by challenges in model privacy and auditability. Model providers want to ensure that (i) their proprietary models are not exposed to third parties; and (ii) be able to get attestations that their genuine models are operating on edge devices in accordance with the service agreement with the user. Existing measures to address these challenges have been hindered by issues such as high overheads and limited capability (processing/secure memory) on edge devices. In this work, we propose GuaranTEE, a framework to provide attestable private machine learning on the edge. GuaranTEE uses Confidential Computing Architecture (CCA), Arm's latest architectural extension that allows for the creation and deployment of dynamic Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) within which models can be executed. We evaluate CCA's feasibility to deploy ML models by developing, evaluating, and openly releasing a prototype. We also suggest improvements to CCA to facilitate its use in protecting the entire ML deployment pipeline on edge devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 4th Workshop on Machine Learning and Systems (EuroMLSys '24)</p></details> |

Such a protocol PoC is situated within a Zero-Trust Architecture (ZTA) and leverages confidential computing, continuous authentication, multi-party computation (MPC), and well-architected framework (WAF) principles to address the challenges of cybersecurity, privacy, and trust over IP (ToIP) protection. Employing a Kubernetes confidential cluster within an Enterprise-Scale Landing Zone (ESLZ), vSPACE integrates Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) for immutable and certifiable audit trails. The Infrastructure as Code (IaC) model ensures rapid deployment, consistent management, and adherence to security standards, making vSPACE a future-proof solution for digital voting systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trustworthy confidential virtual machines for the masses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15277v1)** | 2024-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential computing alleviates the concerns of distrustful customers by removing the cloud provider from their trusted computing base and resolves their disincentive to migrate their workloads to the cloud. This is facilitated by new hardware extensions, like AMD's SEV Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP), which can run a whole virtual machine with confidentiality and integrity protection against a potentially malicious hypervisor owned by an untrusted cloud provider. However, the assurance of such protection to either the service providers deploying sensitive workloads or the end-users passing sensitive data to services requires sending proof to the interested parties. Service providers can retrieve such proof by performing remote attestation while end-users have typically no means to acquire this proof or validate its correctness and therefore have to rely on the trustworthiness of the service providers. In this paper, we present Revelio, an approach that features two main contributions: i) it allows confidential virtual machine (VM)-based workloads to be designed and deployed in a way that disallows any tampering even by the service providers and ii) it empowers users to easily validate their integrity. In particular, we focus on web-facing workloads, protect them leveraging SEV-SNP, and enable end-users to remotely attest them seamlessly each time a new web session is established. To highlight the benefits of Revelio, we discuss how a standalone stateful VM that hosts an open-source collaboration office suite can be secured and present a replicated protocol proxy that enables commodity users to securely access the Internet Computer, a decentralized blockchain infrastructure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy-Enhancing Collaborative Information Sharing through Federated Learning -- A Case of the Insurance Industry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14983v1)** | 2024-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The report demonstrates the benefits (in terms of improved claims loss modeling) of harnessing the value of Federated Learning (FL) to learn a single model across multiple insurance industry datasets without requiring the datasets themselves to be shared from one company to another. The application of FL addresses two of the most pressing concerns: limited data volume and data variety, which are caused by privacy concerns, the rarity of claim events, the lack of informative rating factors, etc.. During each round of FL, collaborators compute improvements on the model using their local private data, and these insights are combined to update a global model. Such aggregation of insights allows for an increase to the effectiveness in forecasting claims losses compared to models individually trained at each collaborator. Critically, this approach enables machine learning collaboration without the need for raw data to leave the compute infrastructure of each respective data owner. Additionally, the open-source framework, OpenFL, that is used in our experiments is designed so that it can be run using confidential computing as well as with additional algorithmic protections against leakage of information via the shared model updates. In such a way, FL is implemented as a privacy-enhancing collaborative learning technique that addresses the challenges posed by the sensitivity and privacy of data in traditional machine learning solutions. This paper's application of FL can also be expanded to other areas including fraud detection, catastrophe modeling, etc., that have a similar need to incorporate data privacy into machine learning collaborations. Our framework and empirical results provide a foundation for future collaborations among insurers, regulators, academic researchers, and InsurTech experts.</p></details> |  |
| **[virtCCA: Virtualized Arm Confidential Compute Architecture with TrustZone](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11011v2)** | 2024-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ARM recently introduced the Confidential Compute Architecture (CCA) as part of the upcoming ARMv9-A architecture. CCA enables the support of confidential virtual machines (cVMs) within a separate world called the Realm world, providing protection from the untrusted normal world. While CCA offers a promising future for confidential computing, the widespread availability of CCA hardware is not expected in the near future, according to ARM's roadmap. To address this gap, we present virtCCA, an architecture that facilitates virtualized CCA using TrustZone, a mature hardware feature available on existing ARM platforms. Notably, virtCCA can be implemented on platforms equipped with the Secure EL2 (S-EL2) extension available from ARMv8.4 onwards, as well as on earlier platforms that lack S-EL2 support. virtCCA is fully compatible with the CCA specifications at the API level. We have developed the entire CCA software and firmware stack on top of virtCCA, including the enhancements to the normal world's KVM to support cVMs, and the TrustZone Management Monitor (TMM) that enforces isolation among cVMs and provides cVM life-cycle management. We have implemented virtCCA on real ARM servers, with and without S-EL2 support. Our evaluation, conducted on micro-benchmarks and macro-benchmarks, demonstrates that the overhead of running cVMs is acceptable compared to running normal-world VMs. Specifically, in a set of real-world workloads, the overhead of virtCCA-SEL2 is less than 29.5% for I/O intensive workloads, while virtCCA-EL3 outperforms the baseline in most cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[HasTEE+ : Confidential Cloud Computing and Analytics with Haskell](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08901v1)** | 2024-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential computing is a security paradigm that enables the protection of confidential code and data in a co-tenanted cloud deployment using specialized hardware isolation units called Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). By integrating TEEs with a Remote Attestation protocol, confidential computing allows a third party to establish the integrity of an \textit{enclave} hosted within an untrusted cloud. However, TEE solutions, such as Intel SGX and ARM TrustZone, offer low-level C/C++-based toolchains that are susceptible to inherent memory safety vulnerabilities and lack language constructs to monitor explicit and implicit information-flow leaks. Moreover, the toolchains involve complex multi-project hierarchies and the deployment of hand-written attestation protocols for verifying \textit{enclave} integrity. We address the above with HasTEE+, a domain-specific language (DSL) embedded in Haskell that enables programming TEEs in a high-level language with strong type-safety. HasTEE+ assists in multi-tier cloud application development by (1) introducing a \textit{tierless} programming model for expressing distributed client-server interactions as a single program, (2) integrating a general remote-attestation architecture that removes the necessity to write application-specific cross-cutting attestation code, and (3) employing a dynamic information flow control mechanism to prevent explicit as well as implicit data leaks. We demonstrate the practicality of HasTEE+ through a case study on confidential data analytics, presenting a data-sharing pattern applicable to mutually distrustful participants and providing overall performance metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>High-...</summary><p>High-quality pdf at https://abhiroop.github.io/pubs/HasTEE_ESORICS_Sarkar_Russo.pdf</p></details> |

We observe that CCA offers the right abstraction and mechanisms to allow confidential VMs to use accelerators as a first-class abstraction. We build ACAI, a CCA-based solution, with a principled approach of extending CCA security invariants to device-side access to address several critical security gaps. Our experimental results on GPU and FPGA demonstrate the feasibility of ACAI while maintaining security guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of the Usenix Security 2024 paper</p></details> |

Existing confidential computing systems cannot be certified for use in critical applications, like systems controlling critical infrastructure, hardware security modules, or aircraft, as they lack formal verification. This paper presents an approach to formally modeling and proving a security monitor. It introduces a canonical architecture for virtual machine (VM)-based confidential computing systems. It abstracts processor-specific components and identifies a minimal set of hardware primitives required by a trusted security monitor to enforce security guarantees. We demonstrate our methodology and proposed approach with an example from our Rust implementation of the security monitor for RISC-V.</p></details> |  |

TEEs use CPU-enabled hardware features to eliminate direct breaches from compromised operating systems or hypervisors. However, recent studies have shown that side-channel attacks are still effective on TEEs. An appealing solution is to convert applications to be \emph{data oblivious} to deter many side-channel attacks. While a few research prototypes on TEEs have adopted specific data oblivious operations, the general conversion approaches have never been thoroughly compared against and tested on benchmark TEE applications. These limitations make it difficult for researchers and practitioners to choose and adopt a suitable data oblivious approach for their applications. To address these issues, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of several representative conversion approaches and implement benchmark TEE applications with them. We also perform an extensive empirical study to provide insights into their performance and ease of use.</p></details> |  |

Provided that the works accomplished in this emerging area are scattered across various research fields, this paper aims at surveying the fundamental concepts, and cutting-edge software and hardware solutions developed for confidential computing using trusted execution environments, homomorphic encryption, and secure enclaves. We underscore the significance of building trust in both hardware and software levels and delve into their applications particularly for machine learning (ML) applications. While substantial progress has been made, there are some barely-explored areas that need extra attention from the researchers and practitioners in the community to improve confidentiality aspects, develop more robust attestation mechanisms, and to address vulnerabilities of the existing trusted execution environments. Providing a comprehensive taxonomy of the confidential computing landscape, this survey enables researchers to advance this field to ultimately ensure the secure processing of users' sensitive data across a multitude of applications and computing tiers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Remote attestation of SEV-SNP confidential VMs using e-vTPMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16463v2)** | 2023-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trying to address the security challenges of a cloud-centric software deployment paradigm, silicon and cloud vendors are introducing confidential computing - an umbrella term aimed at providing hardware and software mechanisms for protecting cloud workloads from the cloud provider and its software stack. Today, Intel SGX, AMD SEV, Intel TDX, etc., provide a way to shield cloud applications from the cloud provider through encryption of the application's memory below the hardware boundary of the CPU, hence requiring trust only in the CPU vendor. Unfortunately, existing hardware mechanisms do not automatically enable the guarantee that a protected system was not tampered with during configuration and boot time. Such a guarantee relies on a hardware RoT, i.e., an integrity-protected location that can store measurements in a trustworthy manner, extend them, and authenticate the measurement logs to the user. In this work, we design and implement a virtual TPM that virtualizes the hardware RoT without requiring trust in the cloud provider. To ensure the security of a vTPM in a provider-controlled environment, we leverage unique isolation properties of the SEV-SNP hardware that allows us to execute secure services as part of the enclave environment protected from the cloud provider. We further develop a novel approach to vTPM state management where the vTPM state is not preserved across reboots. Specifically, we develop a stateless ephemeral vTPM that supports remote attestation without any persistent state on the host. This allows us to pair each confidential VM with a private instance of a vTPM completely isolated from the provider-controlled environment and other VMs. We built our prototype entirely on open-source components. Though our work is AMD-specific, a similar approach could be used to build remote attestation protocols on other trusted execution environments.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

Edge-cloud network suggests splitting and sharing data between the main cloud and the range of networks near the endpoint devices. The proposed solutions allow data in this two-level hierarchy to be protected via embedding traditional encryption at rest and in transit while leaving the remaining security issues, such as sensitive data and operations in use, in the scope of trusted execution environment. Hierarchical data for each network device are linked and identified through distinct paths between edge and main cloud using individual blockchain. Methods for data and cryptographic key splitting between the edge and the main cloud are based on strong authentication techniques ensuring the shared data confidentiality, integrity and availability.</p></details> |  |

One powerful solution for providing both is privacy-preserving computation, where functions are computed directly on encrypted data and control can be provided over how data is used. Garbled circuits (GCs) are a PPC technology that provide both confidential computing and control over how data is used. The challenge is that they incur significant performance overheads compared to plaintext. This paper proposes a novel garbled circuits accelerator and compiler, named HAAC, to mitigate performance overheads and make privacy-preserving computation more practical. HAAC is a hardware-software co-design. GCs are exemplars of co-design as programs are completely known at compile time, i.e., all dependence, memory accesses, and control flow are fixed. The design philosophy of HAAC is to keep hardware simple and efficient, maximizing area devoted to our proposed custom execution units and other circuits essential for high performance (e.g., on-chip storage). The compiler can leverage its program understanding to realize hardware's performance potential by generating effective instruction schedules, data layouts, and orchestrating off-chip events. In taking this approach we can achieve ASIC performance/efficiency without sacrificing generality. Insights of our approach include how co-design enables expressing arbitrary GCs programs as streams, which simplifies hardware and enables complete memory-compute decoupling, and the development of a scratchpad that captures data reuse by tracking program execution, eliminating the need for costly hardware managed caches and tagging logic. We evaluate HAAC with VIP-Bench and achieve an average speedup of 589$\times$ with DDR4 (2,627$\times$ with HBM2) in 4.3mm$^2$ of area.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 50th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)</p></details> |

The questions of how these systems can be built in a trustworthy manner and how their security properties can be understood are given fresh impetus by recent hardware developments, allowing a fuller, more general, exploration of the possibilities than has previously been seen in the literature. Drawing on and consolidating the disparate strains of research, technologies and methods employed throughout the adaptation of confidential computing, we present a novel, dedicated Confidential Remote Computing (CRC) model. CRC proposes a compact solution for next-generation applications to be built on strong hardware-based security primitives, control of secure software products' trusted computing base, and a way to make correct use of proofs and evidence reports generated by the attestation mechanisms. The CRC model illustrates the trade-offs between decentralisation, task size and transparency overhead.

This model is well established in large scale commercial deployment, but the downside is that all platform components and operators are in the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) of the tenant. This aspect is ill-suited for privacy-oriented workloads that aim to minimize the TCB footprint. Confidential computing presents a good stepping-stone towards providing a quantifiable TCB for computing. Confidential computing [1] requires the use of a HW-attested Trusted Execution Environments for data-in-use protection. The RISC-V architecture presents a strong foundation for meeting the requirements for Confidential Computing and other security paradigms in a clean slate manner. This paper describes a reference architecture and discusses ISA, non-ISA and system-on-chip (SoC) requirements for confidential computing on RISC-V Platforms. It discusses proposed ISA and non-ISA Extension for Confidential Virtual Machine for RISC-V platforms, referred to as CoVE.</p></details> |  |

TDX aims to enforce hardware-assisted isolation for virtual machines and minimize the attack surface exposed to host platforms, which are considered to be untrustworthy or adversarial in the confidential computing's new threat model. TDX can be leveraged by regulated industries or sensitive data holders to outsource their computations and data with end-to-end protection in public cloud infrastructure. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of TDX to potential adopters, domain experts, and security researchers looking to leverage the technology for their own purposes. We adopt a top-down approach, starting with high-level security principles and moving to low-level technical details of TDX. Our analysis is based on publicly available documentation and source code, offering insights from security researchers outside of Intel.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI-Driven Confidential Computing across Edge-to-Cloud Continuum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00928v1)** | 2023-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the meteoric growth of technology, individuals and organizations are widely adopting cloud services to mitigate the burdens of maintenance. Despite its scalability and ease of use, many users who own sensitive data refrain from fully utilizing cloud services due to confidentiality concerns. Maintaining data confidentiality for data at rest and in transit has been widely explored but data remains vulnerable in the cloud while it is in use. This vulnerability is further elevated once the scope of computing spans across the edge-to-cloud continuum. Accordingly, the goal of this dissertation is to enable data confidentiality by adopting confidential computing across the continuum. Towards this goal, one approach we explore is to separate the intelligence aspect of data processing from the pattern-matching aspect. We present our approach to make confidential data clustering on the cloud, and then develop confidential search service across edge-to-cloud for unstructured text data. Our proposed clustering solution named ClusPr, performs topic-based clustering for static and dynamic datasets that improves cluster coherency up to 30%-to-60% when compared with other encryption-based clustering techniques. Our trusted enterprise search service named SAED, provides context-aware and personalized semantic search over confidential data across the continuum. We realized that enabling confidential computing across edge-to-cloud requires major contribution from the edge tiers particularly to run multiple Deep Learning (DL) services concurrently. This raises memory contention on the edge tier. To resolve this, we develop Edge-MultiAI framework to manage Neural Network (NN) models of DL applications such that it can meet the latency constraints of the DL applications without compromising inference accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD D...</summary><p>PhD Dissertation advised by Dr. Mohsen Amini Salehi</p></details> |
| **[Confidential High-Performance Computing in the Public Cloud](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02378v1)** | 2022-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-Performance Computing (HPC) in the public cloud democratizes the supercomputing power that most users cannot afford to purchase and maintain. Researchers have studied its viability, performance, and usability. However, HPC in the cloud has a unique feature -- users have to export data and computation to somewhat untrusted cloud platforms. Users will either fully trust cloud providers to protect from all kinds of attacks or keep sensitive assets in-house instead. With the recent deployment of the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) in the cloud, confidential computing for HPC in the cloud is becoming practical for addressing users' privacy concerns. This paper discusses the threat models, unique challenges, possible solutions, and significant gaps, focusing on TEE-based confidential HPC computing. We hope this discussion will improve the understanding of this new topic for HPC in the cloud and promote new research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in IEEE Internet Computing</p></details> |
| **[Empowering Data Centers for Next Generation Trusted Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00306v1)** | 2022-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern data centers have grown beyond CPU nodes to provide domain-specific accelerators such as GPUs and FPGAs to their customers. From a security standpoint, cloud customers want to protect their data. They are willing to pay additional costs for trusted execution environments such as enclaves provided by Intel SGX and AMD SEV. Unfortunately, the customers have to make a critical choice -- either use domain-specific accelerators for speed or use CPU-based confidential computing solutions. To bridge this gap, we aim to enable data-center scale confidential computing that expands across CPUs and accelerators. We argue that having wide-scale TEE-support for accelerators presents a technically easier solution, but is far away from being a reality. Instead, our hybrid design provides enclaved execution guarantees for computation distributed over multiple CPU nodes and devices with/without TEE support. Our solution scales gracefully in two dimensions -- it can handle a large number of heterogeneous nodes and it can accommodate TEE-enabled devices as and when they are available in the future. We observe marginal overheads of $0.42$--$8\%$ on real-world AI data center workloads that are independent of the number of nodes in the data center. We add custom TEE support to two accelerators (AI and storage) and integrate it into our solution, thus demonstrating that it can cater to future TEE devices.</p></details> | 23 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Partially Trusting the Service Mesh Control Plane](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12610v1)** | 2022-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero Trust is a novel cybersecurity model that focuses on continually evaluating trust to prevent the initiation and horizontal spreading of attacks. A cloud-native Service Mesh is an example of Zero Trust Architecture that can filter out external threats. However, the Service Mesh does not shield the Application Owner from internal threats, such as a rogue administrator of the cluster where their application is deployed. In this work, we are enhancing the Service Mesh to allow the definition and reinforcement of a Verifiable Configuration that is defined and signed off by the Application Owner. Backed by automated digital signing solutions and confidential computing technologies, the Verifiable Configuration allows changing the trust model of the Service Mesh, from the data plane fully trusting the control plane to partially trusting it. This lets the application benefit from all the functions provided by the Service Mesh (resource discovery, traffic management, mutual authentication, access control, observability), while ensuring that the Cluster Administrator cannot change the state of the application in a way that was not intended by the Application Owner.</p></details> |  |
| **[CTR: Checkpoint, Transfer, and Restore for Secure Enclaves](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15359v1)** | 2022-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are becoming increasingly prevalent in cloud computing, forming the basis for confidential computing. However, the security goals of TEEs sometimes conflict with existing cloud functionality, such as VM or process migration, because TEE memory cannot be read by the hypervisor, OS, or other software on the platform. Whilst some newer TEE architectures support migration of entire protected VMs, there is currently no practical solution for migrating individual processes containing in-process TEEs. The inability to migrate such processes leads to operational inefficiencies or even data loss if the host platform must be urgently restarted. We present CTR, a software-only design to retrofit migration functionality into existing TEE architectures, whilst maintaining their expected security guarantees. Our design allows TEEs to be interrupted and migrated at arbitrary points in their execution, thus maintaining compatibility with existing VM and process migration techniques. By cooperatively involving the TEE in the migration process, our design also allows application developers to specify stateful migration-related policies, such as limiting the number of times a particular TEE may be migrated. Our prototype implementation for Intel SGX demonstrates that migration latency increases linearly with the size of the TEE memory and is dominated by TEE system operations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Confidential Machine Learning within Graphcore IPUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09005v2)** | 2022-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present IPU Trusted Extensions (ITX), a set of experimental hardware extensions that enable trusted execution environments in Graphcore's AI accelerators. ITX enables the execution of AI workloads with strong confidentiality and integrity guarantees at low performance overheads. ITX isolates workloads from untrusted hosts, and ensures their data and models remain encrypted at all times except within the IPU. ITX includes a hardware root-of-trust that provides attestation capabilities and orchestrates trusted execution, and on-chip programmable cryptographic engines for authenticated encryption of code and data at PCIe bandwidth. We also present software for ITX in the form of compiler and runtime extensions that support multi-party training without requiring a CPU-based TEE. Experimental support for ITX is included in Graphcore's GC200 IPU taped out at TSMC's 7nm technology node. Its evaluation on a development board using standard DNN training workloads suggests that ITX adds less than 5% performance overhead, and delivers up to 17x better performance compared to CPU-based confidential computing systems relying on AMD SEV-SNP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trusted Container Extensions for Container-based Confidential Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05747v1)** | 2022-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud computing has emerged as a corner stone of today's computing landscape. More and more customers who outsource their infrastructure benefit from the manageability, scalability and cost saving that come with cloud computing. Those benefits get amplified by the trend towards microservices. Instead of renting and maintaining full VMs, customers increasingly leverage container technologies, which come with a much more lightweight resource footprint while also removing the need to emulate complete systems and their devices. However, privacy concerns hamper many customers from moving to the cloud and leveraging its benefits. Furthermore, regulatory requirements prevent the adaption of cloud computing in many industries, such as health care or finance. Standard software isolation mechanisms have been proven to be insufficient if the host system is not fully trusted, e.g., when the cloud infrastructure gets compromised by malicious third-party actors. Consequently, confidential computing is gaining increasing relevance in the cloud computing field. We present Trusted Container Extensions (TCX), a novel container security architecture, which combines the manageability and agility of standard containers with the strong protection guarantees of hardware-enforced Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to enable confidential computing for container workloads. TCX provides significant performance advantages compared to existing approaches while protecting container workloads and the data processed by them. Our implementation, based on AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV), ensures integrity and confidentiality of data and services during deployment, and allows secure interaction between protected containers as well as to external entities. Our evaluation shows that our implementation induces a low performance overhead of 5.77% on the standard SPEC2017 benchmark suite.</p></details> |  |
| **[Private delegated computations using strong isolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03322v1)** | 2022-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sensitive computations are now routinely delegated to third-parties. In response, Confidential Computing technologies are being introduced to microprocessors, offering a protected processing environment, which we generically call an isolate, providing confidentiality and integrity guarantees to code and data hosted within -- even in the face of a privileged attacker. Isolates, with an attestation protocol, permit remote third-parties to establish a trusted "beachhead" containing known code and data on an otherwise untrusted machine. Yet, the rise of these technologies introduces many new problems, including: how to ease provisioning of computations safely into isolates; how to develop distributed systems spanning multiple classes of isolate; and what to do about the billions of "legacy" devices without support for Confidential Computing? Tackling the problems above, we introduce Veracruz, a framework that eases the design and implementation of complex privacy-preserving, collaborative, delegated computations among a group of mutually mistrusting principals. Veracruz supports multiple isolation technologies and provides a common programming model and attestation protocol across all of them, smoothing deployment of delegated computations over supported technologies. We demonstrate Veracruz in operation, on private in-cloud object detection on encrypted video streaming from a video camera. In addition to supporting hardware-backed isolates -- like AWS Nitro Enclaves and Arm Confidential Computing Architecture Realms -- Veracruz also provides pragmatic "software isolates" on Armv8-A devices without hardware Confidential Computing capability, using the high-assurance seL4 microkernel and our IceCap framework.</p></details> |  |

This paper first demystifies SEV's improper use of address space identifier (ASID) for controlling accesses of a VM to encrypted memory pages, cache lines, and TLB entries. We then present the CROSSLINE attacks, a novel class of attacks against SEV that allow the adversary to launch an attacker VM and change its ASID to that of the victim VM to impersonate the victim. We present two variants of CROSSLINE attacks: CROSSLINE V1 decrypts victim's page tables or memory blocks following the format of a page table entry; CROSSLINE V2 constructs encryption and decryption oracles by executing instructions of the victim VM. We have successfully performed CROSSLINE attacks on SEV and SEV-ES processors.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, security</p></details> |
| **[Speeding up enclave transitions for IO-intensive applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07339v1)** | 2021-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Process-based confidential computing enclaves such as Intel SGX can be used to protect the confidentiality and integrity of workloads, without the overhead of virtualisation. However, they introduce a notable performance overhead, especially when it comes to transitions in and out of the enclave context. Such overhead makes the use of enclaves impractical for running IO-intensive applications, such as network packet processing or biological sequence analysis. We build on earlier approaches to improve the IO performance of work-loads in Intel SGX enclaves and propose the SGX-Bundler library, which helps reduce the cost of both individual single enclave transitions well as of the total number of enclave transitions in trusted applications running in Intel SGX enclaves. We describe the implementation of the SGX-Bundler library, evaluate its performance and demonstrate its practicality using the case study of Open vSwitch, a widely used software switch implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[PIM-Enclave: Bringing Confidential Computation Inside Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03307v1)** | 2021-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Demand for data-intensive workloads and confidential computing are the prominent research directions shaping the future of cloud computing. Computer architectures are evolving to accommodate the computing of large data better. Protecting the computation of sensitive data is also an imperative yet challenging objective; processor-supported secure enclaves serve as the key element in confidential computing in the cloud. However, side-channel attacks are threatening their security boundaries. The current processor architectures consume a considerable portion of its cycles in moving data. Near data computation is a promising approach that minimizes redundant data movement by placing computation inside storage. In this paper, we present a novel design for Processing-In-Memory (PIM) as a data-intensive workload accelerator for confidential computing. Based on our observation that moving computation closer to memory can achieve efficiency of computation and confidentiality of the processed information simultaneously, we study the advantages of confidential computing \emph{inside} memory. We then explain our security model and programming model developed for PIM-based computation offloading. We construct our findings into a software-hardware co-design, which we call PIM-Enclave. Our design illustrates the advantages of PIM-based confidential computing acceleration. Our evaluation shows PIM-Enclave can provide a side-channel resistant secure computation offloading and run data-intensive applications with negligible performance overhead compared to baseline PIM model.</p></details> |  |
| **[VIA: Analyzing Device Interfaces of Protected Virtual Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10660v1)** | 2021-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Both AMD and Intel have presented technologies for confidential computing in cloud environments. The proposed solutions - AMD SEV (-ES, -SNP) and Intel TDX - protect Virtual Machines (VMs) against attacks from higher privileged layers through memory encryption and integrity protection. This model of computation draws a new trust boundary between virtual devices and the VM, which in so far lacks thorough examination. In this paper, we therefore present an analysis of the virtual device interface and discuss several attack vectors against a protected VM. Further, we develop and evaluate VIA, an automated analysis tool to detect cases of improper sanitization of input recieved via the virtual device interface. VIA improves upon existing approaches for the automated analysis of device interfaces in the following aspects: (i) support for virtualization relevant buses, (ii) efficient Direct Memory Access (DMA) support and (iii) performance. VIA builds upon the Linux Kernel Library and clang's libfuzzer to fuzz the communication between the driver and the device via MMIO, PIO, and DMA. An evaluation of VIA shows that it performs 570 executions per second on average and improves performance compared to existing approaches by an average factor of 2706. Using VIA, we analyzed 22 drivers in Linux 5.10.0-rc6, thereby uncovering 50 bugs and initiating multiple patches to the virtual device driver interface of Linux. To prove our findings criticality under the threat model of AMD SEV and Intel TDX, we showcase three exemplary attacks based on the bugs found. The attacks enable a malicious hypervisor to corrupt the memory and gain code execution in protected VMs with SEV-ES and are theoretically applicable to SEV-SNP and TDX.</p></details> |  |
| **[Encrypted Data Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09821v1)** | 2021-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a comprehensive architecture for confidential computing, which we show to be general purpose and quite efficient. It executes the application as is, without any added burden or discipline requirements from the application developers. Furthermore, it does not require the trust of system software at the computing server and does not impose any added burden on the communication subsystem. The proposed Encrypted Data Processing (EDAP) architecture accomplishes confidentiality, authenticity, and freshness of the key-based cryptographic data protection by adopting data encryption with a multi-level key protection scheme. It guarantees that the user data is visible only in non-privileged mode to a designated program trusted by the data owner on a designated hardware, thus protecting the data from an untrusted hardware, hypervisor, OS, or other users' applications. The cryptographic keys and protocols used for achieving these confidential computing requirements are described in a use case example. Encrypting and decrypting data in an EDAP-enabled processor can lead to performance degradation as it adds cycle time to the overall execution. However, our simulation result shows that the slowdown is only 6% on average across a collection of commercial workloads when the data encryption engine is placed between the L1 and L2 cache. We demonstrate that the EDAP architecture is valuable and practicable in the modern cloud environment for confidential computing. EDAP delivers a zero trust model of computing where the user software does not trust system software and vice versa.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 12 figures, manuscript submitted to ACM Transactions on Privacy and Security</p></details> |

Hard to Trust](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01923v1)** | 2021-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As an emerging technique for confidential computing, trusted execution environment (TEE) receives a lot of attention. To better develop, deploy, and run secure applications on a TEE platform such as Intel's SGX, both academic and industrial teams have devoted much effort to developing reliable and convenient TEE containers. In this paper, we studied the isolation strategies of 15 existing TEE containers to protect secure applications from potentially malicious operating systems (OS) or untrusted applications, using a semi-automatic approach combining a feedback-guided analyzer with manual code review. Our analysis reveals the isolation protection each of these TEE containers enforces, and their security weaknesses. We observe that none of the existing TEE containers can fulfill the goal they set, due to various pitfalls in their design and implementation. We report the lessons learnt from our study for guiding the development of more secure containers, and further discuss the trend of TEE container designs. We also release our analyzer that helps evaluate the container middleware both from the enclave and from the kernel.</p></details> |  |

The proposed design involves the use of a context-aware computing strategy to recognize patterns for simulating human awareness and processing of stereo pattern analysis. It provides a flexible customization method for scene creation and manipulation. It also enables several types of awareness related to the interactive target, user-experience, system performance, confidentiality, and agent identification by applying several strategies, such as context pattern analysis, scalable learning, data-aware confidential computing.</p></details> |  |

| **[Multi-Event Triggers for Serverless Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21199v3)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is an event-driven serverless cloud computing model in which small, stateless functions are invoked in response to events, such as HTTP requests, new database entries, or messages. Current FaaS platform assume that each function invocation corresponds to a single event. However, from an application perspective, it is desirable to invoke functions in response to a collection of events of different types or only with every n\textsuperscript{th} event. To implement this today, a function would need additional state management, e.g., in a database, and custom logic to determine whether its trigger condition is fulfilled and the actual application code should run. In such an implementation, most function invocations would be rendered essentially useless, leading to unnecessarily high resource usage, latency, and cost for applications. In this paper, we introduce multi-event triggers, through which complex conditions for function invocations can be specified. Specifically, we introduce abstractions for invoking functions based on a set of $n$ events and joins of multiple events of different types. This enables application developers to define intricate conditions for function invocations, workflow steps, and complex event processing. Our evaluation with a proof-of-concept prototype shows that this reduces event--invocation latency by 62.5\% in an incident detection use-case and that our system can handle more than 300,000 requests per second on limited hardware, which is sufficient load for implementation in large FaaS platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publishing at IC2E'25</p></details> |
| **[Towards Energy-Efficient Serverless Computing with Hardware Isolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08180v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing provides just-in-time infrastructure provisioning with rapid elasticity and a finely-grained pricing model. As full control of resource allocation is in the hands of the cloud provider and applications only consume resources when they actually perform work, we believe that serverless computing is uniquely positioned to maximize energy efficiency. However, the focus of current serverless platforms is to run hundreds or thousands of serverless functions from different tenants on traditional server hardware, requiring expensive software isolation mechanisms and a high degree of overprovisioning, i.e., idle servers, to anticipate load spikes. With shared caches, high clock frequencies, and many-core architectures, servers today are optimized for large, singular workloads but not to run thousands of isolated functions. We propose rethinking the serverless hardware architecture to align it with the requirements of serverless software. Specifically, we propose using hardware isolation with individual processors per function instead of software isolation resulting in a serverless hardware stack that consumes energy only when an application actually performs work. In preliminary evaluation with real hardware and a typical serverless workload we find that this could reduce energy consumption overheads by 90.63% or an average 70.8MW.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Cosmic AI Inference using Cloud Serverless Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06249v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale astronomical image data processing and prediction are essential for astronomers, providing crucial insights into celestial objects, the universe's history, and its evolution. While modern deep learning models offer high predictive accuracy, they often demand substantial computational resources, making them resource-intensive and limiting accessibility. We introduce the Cloud-based Astronomy Inference (CAI) framework to address these challenges. This scalable solution integrates pre-trained foundation models with serverless cloud infrastructure through a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS). CAI enables efficient and scalable inference on astronomical images without extensive hardware. Using a foundation model for redshift prediction as a case study, our extensive experiments cover user devices, HPC (High-Performance Computing) servers, and Cloud. Using redshift prediction with the AstroMAE model demonstrated CAI's scalability and efficiency, achieving inference on a 12.6 GB dataset in only 28 seconds compared to 140.8 seconds on HPC GPUs and 1793 seconds on HPC CPUs. CAI also achieved significantly higher throughput, reaching 18.04 billion bits per second (bps), and maintained near-constant inference times as data sizes increased, all at minimal computational cost (under $5 per experiment). We also process large-scale data up to 1 TB to show CAI's effectiveness at scale. CAI thus provides a highly scalable, accessible, and cost-effective inference solution for the astronomy community. The code is accessible at https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/AI-for-Astronomy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Function Configuration and its Management in Serverless Computing: A Taxonomy and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02404v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The serverless cloud computing model offers a framework where the service provider abstracts the underlying infrastructure management from developers. In this serverless model, FaaS provides an event-driven, function-oriented computing service characterised by fine-grained, usage-based pricing that eliminates cost for idle resources. Platforms like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Cloud Run Functions require developers to configure their function(s) with minimum operational resources for its successful execution. This resource allocation influences both the operational expense and the performance quality of these functions. However, a noticeable lack of platform transparency forces developers to rely on expert knowledge or experience-based ad-hoc decisions to request desired function resources. This makes optimal resource configuration a non-trivial task while adhering to performance constraints. Furthermore, while commercial platforms often scale resources like CPU and network bandwidth proportional to memory, open-source frameworks permit independent configuration of function resources, introducing additional complexity for developers aiming to optimise their functions. These complexities have directed researchers to resolve developer challenges and advance towards an efficient server-less execution model. In this article, we identify different aspects of resource configuration techniques in FaaS settings and propose a taxonomy of factors that influence function design, configuration, run-time cost, and performance guarantees. We conduct an analysis of existing literature on resource configuration to present a comprehensive review of current studies on function configuration. We also identify existing research gaps and suggest future research directions to enhance function configuration and strengthen the capabilities of serverless computing environments to drive its broader adoption.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables, journal</p></details> |

However, the performance benefits versus trade-offs remain insufficiently understood. This paper presents Lumos, a performance model and benchmarking tool for characterizing serverless runtimes. Lumos identifies workload, system, and environment-level performance drivers in the Edge-Cloud Continuum. We benchmark state-of-the-art containers and the Wasm runtime in interpreted mode and with ahead-of-time compilation. Our performance characterization shows that AoT-compiled Wasm images are up to 30x smaller and decrease cold-start latency by up to 16% compared to containers, while interpreted Wasm suffers up to 55x higher warm latency and up to 10x I/O-serialization overhead.</p></details> |  |

However, compared to virtual machines and container hosting services, modern serverless offerings typically impose higher per-unit time and resource charges. Additionally, billing practices such as wall-clock time allocation-based billing, invocation fees, and usage rounding up can further increase costs. This work, for the first time, holistically demystifies these costs by conducting an in-depth, top-down characterization and analysis from user-facing billing models, through request serving architectures, and down to operating system scheduling on major public serverless platforms. We quantify, for the first time, how current billing practices inflate billable resources up to 4.35x beyond actual consumption. Also, our analysis reveals previously unreported cost drivers, such as operational patterns of serving architectures that create overheads, details of resource allocation during keep-alive periods, and OS scheduling granularity effects that directly impact both performance and billing. By tracing the sources of costs from billing models down to OS scheduling, we uncover the rationale behind today's expensive serverless billing model and practices and provide insights for designing performant and cost-effective serverless systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the Proceedings of the Twenty-First European Conference on Computer Systems (EuroSys '26)</p></details> |

Efforts to mitigate this impact typically focus on the infrastructure level such as powering data centers with renewable energy, or through the specific design of energy-efficient software. However, both strategies rely on stakeholder intervention, making their adoption in legacy and already-deployed systems unlikely. As a result, past architectural and implementation decisions continue to incur additional energy usage - a phenomenon we refer to as energy debt. Hence, in this paper, we investigate the potential of serverless computing platforms to automatically reduce energy debt by leveraging the unique access to function source code. Specifically, we explore whether large language models (LLMs) can translate serverless functions into more energy-efficient programming languages while preserving functional correctness. To this end, we design and implement ReFaaS and integrate it into the Fission serverless framework. We evaluate multiple LLMs on their ability to perform such code translations and analyze their impact on energy consumption. Our preliminary results indicate that translated functions can reduce invocation energy by up to 70%, achieving net energy savings after approximately 3,000 to 5,000 invocations, depending on the LLM used. Nonetheless, the approach faces several challenges: not all functions are suitable for translation, and for some, the amortization threshold is significantly higher or unreachable. Despite these limitations, we identify four key research challenges whose resolution could unlock long-term, automated mitigation of energy debt in serverless computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IC2E 2025</p></details> |

However, public cloud providers often struggle to provide performance guarantees for serverless LLM serving due to significant cold start latency caused by substantial model sizes and complex runtime dependencies. To address this problem, we present HydraServe, a serverless LLM serving system designed to minimize cold start latency in public clouds. HydraServe proactively distributes models across servers to quickly fetch them, and overlaps cold-start stages within workers to reduce startup latency. Additionally, HydraServe strategically places workers across GPUs to avoid network contention among cold-start instances. To minimize resource consumption during cold starts, HydraServe further introduces pipeline consolidation that can merge groups of workers into individual serving endpoints. Our comprehensive evaluations under diverse settings demonstrate that HydraServe reduces the cold start latency by 1.7$\times$-- 4.7$\times$ and improves service level objective attainment by 1.43$\times$--1.74$\times$ compared to baselines.</p></details> | Accepted by NSDI'26 |

Many systems and applications benefit from offloading computations and parallel tasks to dynamically allocated resources. However, the developers of C++ applications find it difficult to integrate functions due to complex deployment, lack of compatibility between client and cloud environments, and loosely typed input and output data. To enable single-source and efficient serverless acceleration in C++, we introduce Cppless, an end-to-end framework for implementing remote functions which handles the creation, deployment, and invocation of serverless functions. Cppless is built on top of LLVM and requires only two compiler extensions to automatically extract C++ function objects and deploy them to the cloud. We demonstrate that offloading parallel computations, such as from a C++ application to serverless workers, can provide up to 59x speedup with minimal cost increase while requiring only minor code modifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of paper accepted at the ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization (TACO) journal</p></details> |
| **[Cost-Performance Analysis: A Comparative Study of CPU-Based Serverless and GPU-Based Training Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14920v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of distributed machine learning (ML) faces increasing demands for scalable and cost-effective training solutions, particularly in the context of large, complex models. Serverless computing has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these challenges by offering dynamic scalability and resource-efficient execution. Building upon our previous work, which introduced the Serverless Peer Integrated for Robust Training (SPIRT) architecture, this paper presents a comparative analysis of several serverless distributed ML architectures. We examine SPIRT alongside established architectures like ScatterReduce, AllReduce, and MLLess, focusing on key metrics such as training time efficiency, cost-effectiveness, communication overhead, and fault tolerance capabilities. Our findings reveal that SPIRT provides significant improvements in reducing training times and communication overhead through strategies such as parallel batch processing and in-database operations facilitated by RedisAI. However, traditional architectures exhibit scalability challenges and varying degrees of vulnerability to faults and adversarial attacks. The cost analysis underscores the long-term economic benefits of SPIRT despite its higher initial setup costs. This study not only highlights the strengths and limitations of current serverless ML architectures but also sets the stage for future research aimed at developing new models that combine the most effective features of existing systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[λScale: Enabling Fast Scaling for Serverless Large Language Model Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09922v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing has emerged as a compelling solution for cloud-based model inference. However, as modern large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in size, existing serverless platforms often face substantial model startup overhead. This poses a significant challenge in efficiently scaling model instances to accommodate dynamic, bursty workloads commonly observed in real-world inference services. In this paper, we introduce {\lambda}Scale, an efficient serverless inference system to achieve fast model scaling. The key idea behind {\lambda}Scale is to leverage high-speed RDMA networks between GPU nodes for fast model multicast, while enabling distributed inference execution during model transmission -- referred to as "execute-while-load". {\lambda}Scale proposes an efficient model scaling scheme, {\lambda}Pipe, which supports adaptive model multicast and dynamically constructs execution pipelines across receiving nodes for collaborative, distributed inference. Additionally, {\lambda}Scale supports efficient model management across GPU and host memory, allowing fast scaling for models across different storage tiers. Evaluation results show that {\lambda}Scale enables fast model scaling and effectively handles load spikes, achieving up to 5x tail-latency improvement and 31.3% cost reduction compared to state-of-the-art solutions on real-world LLM inference traces.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming Serverless Cold Starts Through OS Co-Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14292v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing promises fine-grained elasticity and operational simplicity, fueling widespread interest from both industry and academia. Yet this promise is undercut by the cold setart problem, where invoking a function after a period of inactivity triggers costly initialization before any work can begin. Even with today's high-speed storage, the prevailing view is that achieving sub-millisecond cold starts requires keeping state resident in memory. This paper challenges that assumption. Our analysis of existing snapshot/restore mechanisms show that OS-level limitations, not storage speed, are the real barrier to ultra-fast restores from disk. These limitations force current systems to either restore state piecemeal in a costly manner or capture too much state, leading to longer restore times and unpredictable performance. Futhermore, current memory primitives exposed by the OS make it difficult to reliably fetch data into memory and avoid costly runtime page faults. To overcome these barriers, we present Spice, an execution engine purpose-built for serverless snapshot/restore. Spice integrates directly with the OS to restore kernel state without costly replay and introduces dedicated primitives for restoring memory mappings efficiently and reliably. As a result, Spice delivers near-warm performance on cold restores from disk, reducing latency by up to 14.9x over state-of-the-art process-based systems and 10.6x over VM-based systems. This proves that high performance and memory elasticity no longer need to be a trade-off in serverless computing.</p></details> |  |

Our analysis shows that for these agents, the cost of running on serverless platforms can reach up to 70% of the cost of LLM API calls. This finding motivates the need for a more efficient, high-density serverless platform. We present TrEnv, a co-designed serverless platform that supports both container- and VM-based environments, optimized for the unique demands of LLM agents. TrEnv reduces startup latency and memory usage through repurposable sandboxes and memory templates, which enable fast reuse and restoration of execution environments. To further reduce overhead in VM-based agent workloads, TrEnv leverages browser sharing and a page cache bypassing mechanism. Evaluations show that TrEnv reduces P99 latency by up to 7X and memory usage by 48% in container-based settings, and achieves up to 58% lower P99 latency and 61% memory savings for VM-based agents compared to state-of-the-art systems like E2B.</p></details> | 38 pages |

Existing solutions such as "keep-alive" or "pre-warming" are costly and unreliable under bursty workloads. We propose universal workers, which are computational units capable of executing any function with minimal initialization overhead. Based on an analysis of production workload traces, our key insight is that requests in Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms show a highly skewed distribution, with most requests invoking a small subset of functions. We exploit this observation to approximate universal workers through locality groups and three-tier caching (handler, install, import). With this work, we aim to enable more efficient and scalable FaaS platforms capable of handling diverse workloads with minimal initialization overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the 2025 IEEE 18th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)</p></details> |

Despite its benefits, the distinct characteristics of serverless functions, such as ephemeral execution and fine-grained scalability, pose unique security challenges, particularly in open-source platforms like OpenFaaS. Existing approaches typically address isolated phases of the DevSecOps lifecycle, lacking an integrated and comprehensive security strategy. To bridge this gap, we propose FaaSGuard, a unified DevSecOps pipeline explicitly designed for open-source serverless environments. FaaSGuard systematically embeds lightweight, fail-closed security checks into every stage of the development lifecycle-planning, coding, building, deployment, and monitoring-effectively addressing threats such as injection attacks, hard-coded secrets, and resource exhaustion. We validate our approach empirically through a case study involving 20 real-world serverless functions from public GitHub repositories. Results indicate that FaaSGuard effectively detects and prevents critical vulnerabilities, demonstrating high precision (95%) and recall (91%) without significant disruption to established CI/CD practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Source Code Analysis & Manipulation (SCAM 2025)</p></details> |
| **[The High Cost of Keeping Warm: Characterizing Overhead in Serverless Autoscaling Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03104v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing is transforming cloud application development, but the performance-cost trade-offs of control plane designs remain poorly understood due to a lack of open, cross-platform benchmarks and detailed system analyses. In this work, we address these gaps by designing a serverless system that approximates the scaling behaviors of commercial providers, including AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Run. We systematically compare the performance and cost-efficiency of both synchronous and asynchronous autoscaling policies by replaying real-world workloads and varying key autoscaling parameters. We demonstrate that our open-source systems can closely replicate the operational characteristics of commercial platforms, enabling reproducible and transparent experimentation. By evaluating how autoscaling parameters affect latency, memory usage, and CPU overhead, we reveal several key findings. First, we find that serverless systems exhibit significant computational overhead due to instance churn equivalent to 10-40% of the CPU cycles spent on request handling, primarily originating from worker nodes. Second, we observe high memory allocation due to scaling policy: 2-10 times more than actively used. Finally, we demonstrate that reducing these overheads typically results in significant performance degradation in the current systems, underscoring the need for new, cost-efficient autoscaling strategies. Additionally, we employ a hybrid methodology that combines real control plane deployments with large-scale simulation to extend our evaluation closer to a production scale, thereby bridging the gap between small research clusters and real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Silent Failures in Stateless Systems: Rethinking Anomaly Detection for Serverless Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04969v3)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing has redefined cloud application deployment by abstracting infrastructure and enabling on-demand, event-driven execution, thereby enhancing developer agility and scalability. However, maintaining consistent application performance in serverless environments remains a significant challenge. The dynamic and transient nature of serverless functions makes it difficult to distinguish between benign and anomalous behavior, which in turn undermines the effectiveness of traditional anomaly detection methods. These conventional approaches, designed for stateful and long-running services, struggle in serverless settings where executions are short-lived, functions are isolated, and observability is limited. In this first comprehensive vision paper on anomaly detection for serverless systems, we systematically explore the unique challenges posed by this paradigm, including the absence of persistent state, inconsistent monitoring granularity, and the difficulty of correlating behaviors across distributed functions. We further examine a range of threats that manifest as anomalies, from classical Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks to serverless-specific threats such as Denial-of-Wallet (DoW) and cold start amplification. Building on these observations, we articulate a research agenda for next-generation detection frameworks that address the need for context-aware, multi-source data fusion, real-time, lightweight, privacy-preserving, and edge-cloud adaptive capabilities. Through the identification of key research directions and design principles, we aim to lay the foundation for the next generation of anomaly detection in cloud-native, serverless ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, Preprint accepted at 2025 IEEE International Conference on Service-Oriented System Engineering (SOSE)</p></details> |

However, current serverless inference platforms encounter the coarse-grained and static GPU resource allocation problems during scaling, which leads to high costs and Service Level Objective (SLO) violations in fluctuating workloads. Meanwhile, current platforms only support horizontal scaling for GPU inferences, thus the cold start problem further exacerbates the problems. In this paper, we propose HAS-GPU, an efficient Hybrid Auto-scaling Serverless architecture with fine-grained GPU allocation for deep learning inferences. HAS-GPU proposes an agile scheduler capable of allocating GPU Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) partitions and time quotas with arbitrary granularity and enables significant vertical quota scalability at runtime. To resolve performance uncertainty introduced by massive fine-grained resource configuration spaces, we propose the Resource-aware Performance Predictor (RaPP). Furthermore, we present an adaptive hybrid auto-scaling algorithm with both horizontal and vertical scaling to ensure inference SLOs and minimize GPU costs. The experiments demonstrated that compared to the mainstream serverless inference platform, HAS-GPU reduces function costs by an average of 10.8x with better SLO guarantees. Compared to state-of-the-art spatio-temporal GPU sharing serverless framework, HAS-GPU reduces function SLO violation by 4.8x and cost by 1.72x on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted by Euro-Par 2025</p></details> |
| **[Melding the Serverless Control Plane with the Conventional Cluster Manager for Speed and Resource Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24551v3)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless platforms face a trade-off: conventional cluster managers like Kubernetes offer compatibility for co-locating Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) and Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) components of serverless applications at the cost of high cold-start latency, while specialized FaaS-only systems like Dirigent achieve low latency by sacrificing compatibility, which prevents integrated management and optimization. Our analysis reveals FaaS traffic is bimodal: predictable, sustainable traffic consumes >98% of cluster resources, while sporadic excessive bursts stress the control plane's scaling latency, not its throughput. With these insights, we design PulseNet, a serverless architecture that employs a dual-track control plane tailoring to both traffic types. PulseNet's standard track manages sustainable traffic with long-lived, full-featured Regular Instances under a conventional cluster manager, preserving compatibility and robust features for the majority of the workload. To handle excessive traffic, an expedited track bypasses the slow manager to rapidly create short-lived, disposable Emergency Instances, minimizing cold-start latency and resource waste from idle instances. This hybrid approach achieves 35% better performance than Dirigent, a FaaS-only system, at the same cost and outperforms other Kubernetes-compatible systems by 1.5-3.5x at a 3-70% lower cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Databelt: A Continuous Data Path for Serverless Workflows in the 3D Compute Continuum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15351v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Typically, serverless functions rely on remote storage services for managing state, which can result in increased latency and network communication overhead. In a dynamic environment such as the 3D (Edge-Cloud-Space) Compute Continuum, serverless functions face additional challenges due to frequent changes in network topology. As satellites move in and out of the range of ground stations, functions must make multiple hops to access cloud services, leading to high-latency state access and unnecessary data transfers. In this paper, we present Databelt, a state management framework for serverless workflows designed for the dynamic environment of the 3D Compute Continuum. Databelt introduces an SLO-aware state propagation mechanism that enables the function state to move continuously in orbit. Databelt proactively offloads function states to the most suitable node, such that when functions execute, the data is already present on the execution node or nearby, thus minimizing state access latency and reducing the number of network hops. Additionally, Databelt introduces a function state fusion mechanism that abstracts state management for functions sharing the same serverless runtime. When functions are fused, Databelt seamlessly retrieves their state as a group, reducing redundant network and storage operations and improving overall workflow efficiency. Our experimental results show that Databelt reduces workflow execution time by up to 66% and increases throughput by 50% compared to the baselines. Furthermore, our results show that Databelt function state fusion reduces storage operations latency by up to 20%, by reducing repetitive storage requests for functions within the same runtime, ensuring efficient execution of serverless workflows in highly dynamic network environments such as the 3D Continuum.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, which aim to exhaust resources and disrupt service availability, DoW attacks focus on escalating costs without impacting service operation. This review traces the evolution of DoW research, from initial awareness and attack classification to advancements in detection and mitigation strategies. Key developments include the categorisation of attack types-such as Blast DDoW, Continual Inconspicuous DDoW, and Background Chained DDoW-and the creation of simulation tools like DoWTS, which enable safe experimentation and data generation. Recent advancements highlight machine learning approaches, including systems like Gringotts and DoWNet, which leverage deep learning and anomaly detection to identify malicious traffic patterns. Although substantial progress has been made, challenges persist, notably the lack of real-world data and the need for adaptive billing models. This is the first comprehensive literature review dedicated strictly to Denial of Wallet attacks, providing an in-depth analysis of their financial impacts, attack techniques, mitigation strategies, and detection mechanisms within serverless computing. The paper also presents the first detailed examination of simulation and data generation tools used for DoW research, addressing a critical gap in existing cybersecurity literature. By synthesising these key areas, this study serves as a foundational resource for future research and industry efforts in securing pay-as-you-go cloud environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Developers sometimes add a cache layer between the serverless runtime and the database to improve I/O latency. However, in a serverless environment, functions in the same workflow may be scheduled to different nodes with different caches, which can cause non-intuitive anomalies. This paper presents CausalMesh, a novel approach to causally consistent caching in environments where a computation may migrate from one machine to another, such as in serverless computing. CausalMesh is the first cache system that supports coordination-free and abort-free read/write operations and read transactions when clients roam among multiple servers. CausalMesh also supports read-write transactional causal consistency in the presence of client roaming, but at the cost of abort-freedom.

While Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs) offer a promising secure execution environment, their integration with serverless architectures currently faces fundamental limitations in key areas: security, performance, and resource efficiency. We present WALLET, a confidential computing system for secure serverless deployments to overcome these limitations. By employing nested confidential execution and a decoupled guest OS within CVMs, WALLET runs each function in a minimal "trustlet", significantly improving security through a reduced Trusted Computing Base (TCB). Furthermore, by leveraging a data-centric I/O architecture built upon a lightweight LibOS, WALLET optimizes network communication to address performance and resource efficiency challenges. Our evaluation shows that compared to CVM-based deployments, WALLET has 4.3x smaller TCB, improves end-to-end latency (15-93%), achieves higher function density (up to 907x), and reduces inter-function communication (up to 27x) and function chaining latency (16.7-30.2x); thus, WALLET offers a practical system for confidential serverless computing.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a predictive serverless scheduling framework based on Model Predictive Control to proactively mitigate cold starts, thereby improving end-to-end response time. By forecasting future invocations, the controller jointly optimizes container prewarming and request dispatching, improving latency while minimizing resource overhead. We implement our approach on Apache OpenWhisk, deployed on a Kubernetes-based testbed.

With an Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) approach, frameworks like the Serverless Framework use YAML configurations to define and deploy APIs, tasks, workflows, and event-driven applications on cloud providers, promoting zero-friction development. As with any rapidly evolving ecosystem, there is a need for updated insights into how these tools are used in real-world projects. Building on the methodology established by the Wonderless dataset for serverless computing (and applying multiple new filtering steps), OpenLambdaVerse addresses this gap by creating a dataset of current GitHub repositories that use the Serverless Framework in applications that contain one or more AWS Lambda functions. We then analyze and characterize this dataset to get an understanding of the state-of-the-art in serverless architectures based on this stack. Through this analysis we gain important insights on the size and complexity of current applications, which languages and runtimes they employ, how are the functions triggered, the maturity of the projects, and their security practices (or lack of). OpenLambdaVerse thus offers a valuable, up-to-date resource for both practitioners and researchers that seek to better understand evolving serverless workloads.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 13th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering (IC2E 2025, accepted, to appear)</p></details> |

This gives rise to present an abstract architecture of CNApp as dynamically re-configurable acyclic directed multi graph where vertices are microservices, and edges are the protocols. Generic mechanisms for such reconfigurations evidently correspond to higher-level functions (functionals). This implies also internal abstract architecture of microservice as a collection of event-triggered serverless functions (including functions implementing the protocols) that are composed into event-dependent data-flow graphs, and dynamically reconfigured at the runtime. Again, generic mechanisms for such compositions and reconfigurations correspond to functionals and higher order type theory like Coq https://coq.inria.fr/about-coq. Our contribution is strictly theoretical and relies on the abstract architecture of CNApp that is closely related to the calculus of functionals and relations.

As a result, serverless is becoming increasingly popular to support highly elastic and bursty workloads. However, existing platforms are supported by bloated virtualization stacks, which, combined with bursty and irregular invocations, lead to high memory and latency overheads. To reduce the virtualization stack bloat, we propose Hydra, a virtualized multi-language runtime and platform capable of hosting multiple sandboxes running concurrently. To fully leverage Hydra's virtualized runtime, we revisit the existing serverless platform design to make it colocation-aware across owners and functions, and to feature a caching layer of pre-allocated Hydra instances that can be used by different functions written in different languages to reduce cold starts. We also propose a snapshotting mechanism to checkpoint and restore individual sandboxes. By consolidating multiple serverless function invocations through Hydra, we improve the overall function density (ops/GB-sec) by 2.41x on average compared to OpenWhisk runtimes, the state-of-the-art single-language runtimes used in most serverless platforms, and by 1.43x on average compared to Knative runtimes supporting invocation colocation within the same function. When reproducing the Azure Functions trace, our serverless platform operating Hydra instances reduces the overall memory footprint by 21.3-43.9% compared to operating OpenWhisk instances and by 14.5-30% compared to operating Knative instances. Hydra eliminates cold starts thanks to the pool of pre-warmed runtime instances, reducing p99 latency by 45.3-375.5x compared to OpenWhisk and by 1.9-51.4x compared to Knative.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches often rely on uniform reactive policies or unconditioned predictive models, ignoring both workload semantics and prediction uncertainty. We present AAPA, an archetype-aware predictive autoscaler that classifies workloads into four behavioral patterns -- SPIKE, PERIODIC, RAMP, and STATIONARY -- and applies tailored scaling strategies with confidence-based adjustments. To support reproducible evaluation, we release AAPAset, a weakly labeled dataset of 300,000 Azure Functions workload windows spanning diverse patterns. AAPA reduces SLO violations by up to 50% and lowers latency by 40% compared to Kubernetes HPA, albeit at 2-8x higher resource usage under spike-dominated conditions. To assess trade-offs, we propose the Resource Efficiency Index (REI), a unified metric balancing performance, cost, and scaling smoothness.

| **[Making Serverless Computing Extensible: A Case Study of Serverless Data Analytics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11929v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing has attracted a broad range of applications due to its ease of use and resource elasticity. However, developing serverless applications often poses a dilemma -- relying on general-purpose serverless platforms can fall short of delivering satisfactory performance for complex workloads, whereas building application-specific serverless systems undermines the simplicity and generality. In this paper, we propose an extensible design principle for serverless computing. We argue that a platform should enable developers to extend system behaviors for domain-specialized optimizations while retaining a shared, easy-to-use serverless environment. We take data analytics as a representative serverless use case and realize this design principle in Proteus. Proteus introduces a novel abstraction of decision workflows, allowing developers to customize control-plane behaviors for improved application performance. Preliminary results show that Proteus's prototype effectively optimizes analytical query execution and supports fine-grained resource sharing across diverse applications.</p></details> |  |

This paper documents the design, implementation, and iterative debugging of a novel, serverless system for real-time stock analysis. The system leverages the Gemini API for qualitative assessment, automates data ingestion and processing via GitHub Actions, and presents the findings through a decoupled, static frontend. We detail the architectural evolution of the system, from initial concepts to a robust, event-driven pipeline, highlighting the practical challenges encountered during deployment. A significant portion of this paper is dedicated to a case study on the debugging process, covering common software errors, platform-specific permission issues, and rare, environment-level platform bugs. The final architecture operates at a near-zero cost, demonstrating a viable model for individuals to build sophisticated AI-powered financial tools. The operational application is publicly accessible, and the complete source code is available for review. We conclude by discussing the role of LLMs in financial analysis, the importance of robust debugging methodologies, and the emerging paradigm of human-AI collaboration in software development.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages.

| **[HotSwap: Enabling Live Dependency Sharing in Serverless Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09202v3)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents HotSwap, a novel provider-side cold-start optimization for serverless computing. This optimization reduces cold-start time when booting and loading dependencies at runtime inside a function container. Previous research has extensively focused on reducing cold-start latency for specific functions. However, little attention has been given to skewed production workloads. In such cases, cross-function optimization becomes essential. Without cross-function optimization, a cloud provider is left with two equally poor options: (i) Either the cloud provider gives up optimization for each function in the long tail (which is slow); or (ii) the cloud provider applies function-specific optimizations (e.g., cache function images) to every function in the long tail (which violates the vendor's cache constraints). HotSwap demonstrates cross-function optimization using a novel pre-warming strategy. In this strategy, a pre-initialized live dependency image is migrated to the new function instance. At the same time, HotSwap respects the provider's cache constraints, because a single pre-warmed dependency image in the cache can be shared among all serverless functions that require that image. HotSwap has been tested on seven representative functions from FunctionBench. In those tests, HotSwap accelerates dependency loading for those serverless functions with large dependency requirements by a factor ranging from 2.2 to 3.2. Simulation experiments using Azure traces indicate that HotSwap can save 88\% of space, compared with a previous function-specific method, PreBaking, when sharing a dependency image among ten different functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Torpor: GPU-Enabled Serverless Computing for Low-Latency, Resource-Efficient Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03622v3)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing offers a compelling cloud model for online inference services. However, existing serverless platforms lack efficient support for GPUs, hindering their ability to deliver high-performance inference. In this paper, we present Torpor, a serverless platform for GPU-efficient, low-latency inference. To enable efficient sharing of a node's GPUs among numerous inference functions, Torpor maintains models in main memory and dynamically swaps them onto GPUs upon request arrivals (i.e., late binding with model swapping). Torpor uses various techniques, including asynchronous API redirection, GPU runtime sharing, pipelined model execution, and efficient GPU memory management, to minimize latency overhead caused by model swapping. Additionally, we design an interference-aware request scheduling algorithm that utilizes high-speed GPU interconnects to meet latency service-level objectives (SLOs) for individual inference functions. We have implemented Torpor and evaluated its performance in a production environment. Utilizing late binding and model swapping, Torpor can concurrently serve hundreds of inference functions on a worker node with 4 GPUs, while achieving latency performance comparable to native execution, where each model is cached exclusively on a GPU. Pilot deployment in a leading commercial serverless cloud shows that Torpor reduces the GPU provisioning cost by 70% and 65% for users and the platform, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hiku: Pull-Based Scheduling for Serverless Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15534v2)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing promises convenient abstractions for developing and deploying functions that execute in response to events. In such Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms, scheduling is an integral task, but current scheduling algorithms often struggle with maintaining balanced loads, minimizing cold starts, and adapting to commonly occurring bursty workloads. In this work, we propose pull-based scheduling as a novel scheduling algorithm for serverless computing. Our key idea is to decouple worker selection from task assignment, with idle workers requesting new tasks proactively. Experimental evaluation on an open-source FaaS platform shows that pull-based scheduling, compared to other existing scheduling algorithms, significantly improves the performance and load balancing of serverless workloads, especially under high concurrency. The proposed algorithm improves response latencies by 14.9% compared to hash-based scheduling, reduces the frequency of cold starts from 43% to 30%, increases throughput by 8.3%, and achieves a more even load distribution by 12.9% measured by the requests assigned per worker.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the 2025 IEEE 25th International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing (CCGrid)</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Mesh: Enabling Elastic Sharing for Serverless LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00507v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of LLMs has driven demand for private serverless deployments, characterized by moderate-scale models and infrequent requests. While existing solutions follow exclusive GPU deployment, we take a step back to explore modern platforms and find that: Emerging CPU architectures with built-in accelerators are capable of serving LLMs but remain underutilized, and both CPUs and GPUs can accommodate multiple LLMs simultaneously. We propose LLM-Mesh, a serverless inference scheme for small-to-mid-sized LLMs that enables elastic sharing across heterogeneous hardware. LLM-Mesh tackles three fundamental challenges: (1) precise, fine-grained compute resource allocation at token-level to handle fluctuating computational demands; (2) a coordinated and forward-looking memory scaling mechanism to detect out-of-memory hazards and reduce operational overhead; and (3) a dual approach that reduces resource fragmentation through proactive preemption and reactive bin-packing. Experimental results on 4 32-core CPUs and 4 A100 GPUs show that LLM-Meshimproves service capacity by 44% - 63% through sharing, while further leveraging CPUs boosts this to 91% - 159%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cicada: A Pipeline-Efficient Approach to Serverless Inference with Decoupled Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20959v2)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing has emerged as a pivotal paradigm for deploying Deep Learning (DL) models, offering automatic scaling and cost efficiency. However, the inherent cold start problem in serverless ML inference systems, particularly the time-consuming model loading process, remains a significant bottleneck. Utilizing pipelined model loading improves efficiency but still suffer from pipeline stalls due to sequential layer construction and monolithic weight loading. In this paper, we propose \textit{Cicada}, a novel pipeline optimization framework that coordinates computational, storage, and scheduling resources through three key mechanisms: (1) \textit{MiniLoader}: which reduces layer construction overhead by opportunistically optimizing parameter initialization; (2) \textit{WeightDecoupler}: decoupling weight file processing from layer construction, enabling asynchronous weight retrieval and out-of-order weight application; (3) \textit{Priority-Aware Scheduler}: dynamically allocating resources to ensure high-priority inference tasks are executed promptly. Our experimental results demonstrate that Cicada achieves significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art PISeL framework. Specifically, Cicada reduces end-to-end inference latency by an average of 61.59\%, with the MiniLoader component contributing the majority of this optimization (53.41\%), and the WeightDecoupler achieves up to 26.17\% improvement. Additionally, Cicada achieves up to 2.52x speedup in the inference pipeline utlization compared to PISeL.</p></details> | 13pages, 14 figures |

DEEPSERVE addresses key challenges such as resource allocation, serving efficiency, and cold start latencies through four main design components. First, DEEPSERVE uses a simple serverless abstraction called the request-job-task model, which helps manage diverse AI workloads across posttraining and model-serving tasks. Second, DEEPSERVE integrates an in-house serving engine named FLOWSERVE using a microkernel-inspired design, NPU-centric execution, and SPMD-based parallelism to optimize LLM serving. Third, DEEPSERVE includes novel scheduling policies tailored for a configuration with both PD-disaggregated and PD-colocated instances. Fourth, DEEPSERVE includes optimizations such as pre-warmed pods, DRAM pre-loading, and NPU-fork, which allow DEEPSERVE to scale up to 64 instances in seconds. DEEPSERVE has been in production for over a year, operating on a large Ascend NPU cluster and providing industrystandard APIs for fine-tuning, agent serving, and model serving to our customers.</p></details> |  |

| **[Joint$λ$: Orchestrating Serverless Workflows on Jointcloud FaaS Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21899v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing serverless workflow orchestration systems are predominantly designed for a single-cloud FaaS system, leading to vendor lock-in. This restricts performance optimization, cost reduction, and availability of applications. However, orchestrating serverless workflows on Jointcloud FaaS systems faces two main challenges: 1) Additional overhead caused by centralized cross-cloud orchestration; and 2) A lack of reliable failover and fault-tolerant mechanisms for cross-cloud serverless workflows. To address these challenges, we propose Joint$\lambda$, a distributed runtime system designed to orchestrate serverless workflows on multiple FaaS systems without relying on a centralized orchestrator. Joint$\lambda$ introduces a compatibility layer, Backend-Shim, leveraging inter-cloud heterogeneity to optimize makespan and reduce costs with on-demand billing. By using function-side orchestration instead of centralized nodes, it enables independent function invocations and data transfers, reducing cross-cloud communication overhead. For high availability, it ensures exactly-once execution via datastores and failover mechanisms for serverless workflows on Jointcloud FaaS systems. We validate Joint$\lambda$ on two heterogeneous FaaS systems, AWS and ALiYun, with four workflows. Compared to the most advanced commercial orchestration services for single-cloud serverless workflows, Joint$\lambda$ reduces up to 3.3$\times$ latency, saving up to 65\% cost. Joint$\lambda$ is also faster than the state-of-the-art orchestrators for cross-cloud serverless workflows up to 4.0$\times$, reducing up to 4.5$\times$ cost and providing strong execution guarantees.</p></details> |  |
| **[ServerlessLoRA: Minimizing Latency and Cost in Serverless Inference for LoRA-Based LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14468v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing has grown rapidly for serving Large Language Model (LLM) inference due to its pay-as-you-go pricing, fine-grained GPU usage, and rapid scaling. However, our analysis reveals that current serverless can effectively serve general LLM but fail with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) inference due to three key limitations: 1) massive parameter redundancy among functions where 99% of weights are unnecessarily duplicated, 2) costly artifact loading latency beyond LLM loading, and 3) magnified resource contention when serving multiple LoRA LLMs. These inefficiencies lead to massive GPU wastage, increased Time-To-First-Token (TTFT), and high monetary costs. We propose ServerlessLoRA, a novel serverless inference system designed for faster and cheaper LoRA LLM serving. ServerlessLoRA enables secure backbone LLM sharing across isolated LoRA functions to reduce redundancy. We design a pre-loading method that pre-loads comprehensive LoRA artifacts to minimize cold-start latency. Furthermore, ServerlessLoRA employs contention aware batching and offloading to mitigate GPU resource conflicts during bursty workloads. Experiment on industrial workloads demonstrates that ServerlessLoRA reduces TTFT by up to 86% and cuts monetary costs by up to 89% compared to state-of-the-art LLM inference solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Palladium: A DPU-enabled Multi-Tenant Serverless Cloud over Zero-copy Multi-node RDMA Fabrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11339v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing promises enhanced resource efficiency and lower user costs, yet is burdened by a heavyweight, CPU-bound data plane. Prior efforts exploiting shared memory reduce overhead locally but fall short when scaling across nodes. Furthermore, serverless environments can have unpredictable and large-scale multi-tenancy, leading to contention for shared network resources. We present Palladium, a DPU-centric serverless data plane that reduces the CPU burden and enables efficient, zero-copy communication in multi-tenant serverless clouds. Despite the limited general-purpose processing capability of the DPU cores, Palladium strategically exploits the DPU's potential by (1) offloading data transmission to high-performance NIC cores via RDMA, combined with intra-node shared memory to eliminate data copies across nodes, and (2) enabling cross-processor (CPU-DPU) shared memory to eliminate redundant data movement, which overwhelms wimpy DPU cores. At the core of Palladium is the DPU-enabled network engine (DNE) -- a lightweight reverse proxy that isolates RDMA resources from tenant functions, orchestrates inter-node RDMA flows, and enforces fairness under contention. To further reduce CPU involvement, Palladium performs early HTTP/TCP-to-RDMA transport conversion at the cloud ingress, bridging the protocol mismatch before client traffic enters the RDMA fabric, thus avoiding costly protocol translation along the critical path. We show that careful selection of RDMA primitives (i.e., two-sided instead of one-sided) significantly affects the zero-copy data plane. Our preliminary experimental results show that enabling DPU offloading in Palladium improves RPS by 20.9x. The latency is reduced by a factor of 21x in the best case, all the while saving up to 7 CPU cores, and only consuming two wimpy DPU cores.</p></details> |  |
| **[ABase: the Multi-Tenant NoSQL Serverless Database for Diverse and Dynamic Workloads in Large-scale Cloud Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07692v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-tenant architectures enhance the elasticity and resource utilization of NoSQL databases by allowing multiple tenants to co-locate and share resources. However, in large-scale cloud environments, the diverse and dynamic nature of workloads poses significant challenges for multi-tenant NoSQL databases. Based on our practical observations, we have identified three crucial challenges: (1) the impact of caching on performance isolation, as cache hits alter request execution and resource consumption, leading to inaccurate traffic control; (2) the dynamic changes in traffic, with changes in tenant traffic trends causing throttling or resource wastage, and changes in access distribution causing hot key pressure or cache hit ratio drops; and (3) the imbalanced layout of data nodes due to tenants' diverse resource requirements, leading to low resource utilization. To address these challenges, we introduce ABase, a multi-tenant NoSQL serverless database developed at ByteDance. ABase introduces a two-layer caching mechanism with a cache-aware isolation mechanism to ensure accurate resource consumption estimates. Furthermore, ABase employs a predictive autoscaling policy to dynamically adjust resources in response to tenant traffic changes and a multi-resource rescheduling algorithm to balance resource utilization across data nodes. With these innovations, ABase has successfully served ByteDance's large-scale cloud environment, supporting a total workload that has achieved a peak QPS of over 13 billion and total storage exceeding 1 EB.</p></details> | SIGMOD 2025 accepted |

However, deploying serverless functions across dynamic and heterogeneous environments such as the 3D (Edge-Cloud-Space) Continuum introduces additional complexity. Each layer of the 3D Continuum shows different performance capabilities and costs according to workload characteristics. Cloud services alone often show significant differences in performance and pricing for similar functions, further complicating cost management. Additionally, serverless workflows consist of functions with diverse characteristics, requiring a granular understanding of performance and cost trade-offs across different infrastructure layers to be able to address them individually. In this paper, we present Cosmos, a cost- and a performance-cost-tradeoff model for serverless workflows that identifies key factors that affect cost changes across different workloads and cloud providers. We present a case study analyzing the main drivers that influence the costs of serverless workflows. We demonstrate how to classify the costs of serverless workflows in leading cloud providers AWS and GCP. Our results show that for data-intensive functions, data transfer and state management costs contribute to up to 75% of the costs in AWS and 52% in GCP. For compute-intensive functions such as AI inference, the cost results show that BaaS services are the largest cost driver, reaching up to 83% in AWS and 97% in GCP.</p></details> |  |

In composed workflows, where serverless functions need to exchange data constantly, serverless platforms rely on remote services such as object storage and key-value stores as a common approach to exchange data. In WebAssembly, functions leverage WebAssembly System Interface to connect to the network and exchange data via remote services. As a consequence, co-located serverless functions need remote services to exchange data, increasing latency and adding network overhead. To mitigate this problem, in this paper, we introduce CWASI: a WebAssembly OCI-compliant runtime shim that determines the best inter-function data exchange approach based on the serverless function locality. CWASI introduces a three-mode communication model for the Serverless Edge-Cloud continuum. This communication model enables CWASI Shim to optimize inter-function communication for co-located functions by leveraging the function host mechanisms. Experimental results show that CWASI reduces the communication latency between the co-located serverless functions by up to 95% and increases the communication throughput by up to 30x.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the Eighth ACM/IEEE Symposium on Edge Computing</p></details> |

However, despite these advantages, it faces the significant challenge of cold-start latency, adversely impacting end-to-end performance. Our study shows that many serverless functions initialize libraries that are rarely or never used under typical workloads, thus introducing unnecessary overhead. Although existing static analysis techniques can identify unreachable libraries, they fail to address workload-dependent inefficiencies, resulting in limited performance improvements. To overcome these limitations, we present SLIMSTART, a profile-guided optimization tool designed to identify and mitigate inefficient library usage patterns in serverless applications. By leveraging statistical sampling and call-path profiling, SLIMSTART collects runtime library usage data, generates detailed optimization reports, and applies automated code transformations to reduce cold-start overhead. Furthermore, SLIMSTART integrates seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines, enabling adaptive monitoring and continuous optimizations tailored to evolving workloads. Through extensive evaluation across three benchmark suites and four real-world serverless applications, SLIMSTART achieves up to a 2.30X speedup in initialization latency, a 2.26X improvement in end-to-end latency, and a 1.51X reduction in memory usage, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing cold-start inefficiencies and optimizing resource utilization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 45th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS 2025)</p></details> |

With latency propagation effects becoming increasingly prominent, step-wise resource tuning is required to address Service-Level-Objectives (SLOs). Modern processors' allowance for fine-grained Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), coupled with serverless workflows' intermittent nature, presents a unique opportunity to reduce power while meeting SLOs. We introduce $\Omega$kypous, an SLO-driven DVFS framework for serverless workflows. $\Omega$kypous employs a grey-box model that predicts functions' execution latency and power under different Core and Uncore frequency combinations. Based on these predictions and the timing slacks between workflow functions, $\Omega$kypous uses a closed-loop control mechanism to dynamically adjust Core and Uncore frequencies, thus minimizing power consumption without compromising predefined end-to-end latency constraints. Our evaluation on real-world traces from Azure, against state-of-the-art power management frameworks, demonstrates an average power consumption reduction of 16\%, while consistently maintaining low SLO violation rates (1.8\%), when operating under power caps.</p></details> |  |

However, current orbital edge computing architectures are inflexible, requiring custom mission planning and high upfront development costs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach: shared Earth observation satellites that are operated by a central provider but used by multiple tenants. Each tenant can execute their own logic on-board the satellite to filter, prioritize, and analyze sensor data. We introduce Trabant, a serverless architecture for shared satellite platforms, leveraging the Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) paradigm and time-shifted computing. This architecture abstracts operational complexities, enabling dynamic scheduling under satellite resource constraints, reducing deployment overhead, and aligning event-driven satellite observations with intermittent computation. We present the design of Trabant, demonstrate its capabilities with a proof-of-concept prototype, and evaluate it using real satellite computing telemetry data. Our findings suggest that Trabant can significantly reduce mission planning overheads, offering a scalable and efficient platform for diverse Earth observation missions.</p></details> |  |

However, resource allocation for workflows, particularly those with branching structures, is complicated by cold starts and network delays between dependent functions, significantly degrading execution efficiency and response times. In this paper, we propose the Invocation Concurrency Prediction-Based Scaling (ICPS) algorithm to address these challenges. ICPS employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict function concurrency, dynamically pre-warming function instances, and an affinity-based deployment strategy to co-locate dependent functions on the same worker node, minimizing network latency. The experimental results demonstrate that ICPS consistently outperforms existing approaches in diverse scenarios. The results confirm ICPS as a robust and scalable solution for optimizing serverless workflow execution.</p></details> |  |

While this model offers advantages such as abstraction from the deployment and resource scheduling, it also poses limitations in handling complex use cases due to the restricted nature of individual functions. Serverless workflows address this limitation by orchestrating multiple functions into a cohesive application. However, existing serverless workflow platforms exhibit significant differences in their programming models and infrastructure, making fair and consistent performance evaluations difficult in practice. To address this gap, we propose the first serverless workflow benchmarking suite SeBS-Flow, providing a platform-agnostic workflow model that enables consistent benchmarking across various platforms. SeBS-Flow includes six real-world application benchmarks and four microbenchmarks representing different computational patterns. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on three major cloud platforms, assessing performance, cost, scalability, and runtime deviations. We make our benchmark suite open-source, enabling rigorous and comparable evaluations of serverless workflows over time.</p></details> |  |

Many LLM inference tasks rely on the same base model (e.g., LoRA). To leverage this, PipeBoost introduces fault-tolerant pipeline parallelism across both model loading and inference stages. This approach maximizes aggregate PCIe bandwidth and parallel computation across GPUs, enabling faster generation of the first token. PipeBoost also introduces recovery techniques that enable uninterrupted inference services by utilizing the shared advantages of multiple GPUs. Experimental results show that, compared to state-of-the-art low-latency LLM serving systems, PipeBoost reduces inference latency by 31% to 49.8%. For certain models (e.g., OPT-1.3B), PipeBoost achieves cold-start latencies in the range of a few hundred microseconds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Acurast: Decentralized Serverless Cloud](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15654v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Centralized trust is ubiquitous in today's interconnected world, from computational resources to data storage and its underlying infrastructure. The monopolization of cloud computing resembles a feudalistic system, causing a loss of privacy and data ownership. Cloud Computing and the Internet in general face widely recognized challenges, such as (1) the centralization of trust in auxiliary systems (e.g., centralized cloud providers), (2) the seamless and permissionless interoperability of fragmented ecosystems and (2) the effectiveness, verifiability, and confidentiality of the computation. Acurast is a decentralized serverless cloud that addresses all these shortcomings, following the call for a global-scale cloud founded on the principles of the open-source movement. In Acurast, a purpose-built orchestrator, a reputation engine, and an attestation service are enshrined in the consensus layer.

| **[FaaSMT: Lightweight Serverless Framework for Intrusion Detection Using Merkle Tree and Task Inlining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06532v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The serverless platform aims to facilitate cloud applications' straightforward deployment, scaling, and management. Unfortunately, the distributed nature of serverless computing makes it difficult to port traditional security tools directly. The existing serverless solutions primarily identify potential threats or performance bottlenecks through post-analysis of modified operating system audit logs, detection of encrypted traffic offloading, or the collection of runtime metrics. However, these methods often prove inadequate for comprehensively detecting communication violations across functions. This limitation restricts the real-time log monitoring and validation capabilities in distributed environments while impeding the maintenance of minimal communication overhead. Therefore, this paper presents FaaSMT, which aims to fill this gap by addressing research questions related to security checks and the optimization of performance and costs in serverless applications. This framework employs parallel processing for the collection of distributed data logs, incorporating Merkle Tree algorithms and heuristic optimisation methods to achieve adaptive inline security task execution. The results of experimental trials demonstrate that FaaSMT is capable of effectively identifying major attack types (e.g., Denial of Wallet (DoW) and Business Logic attacks), thereby providing comprehensive monitoring and validation of function executions while significantly reducing performance overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dilu: Enabling GPU Resourcing-on-Demand for Serverless DL Serving via Introspective Elasticity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05130v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing, with its ease of management, auto-scaling, and cost-effectiveness, is widely adopted by deep learning (DL) applications. DL workloads, especially with large language models, require substantial GPU resources to ensure QoS. However, it is prone to produce GPU fragments (e.g., 15\%-94\%) in serverless DL systems due to the dynamicity of workloads and coarse-grained static GPU allocation mechanisms, gradually eroding the profits offered by serverless elasticity. Different from classical serverless systems that only scale horizontally, we present introspective elasticity (IE), a fine-grained and adaptive two-dimensional co-scaling mechanism to support GPU resourcing-on-demand for serverless DL tasks. Based on this insight, we build Dilu, a cross-layer and GPU-based serverless DL system with IE support. First, Dilu provides multi-factor profiling for DL tasks with efficient pruning search methods. Second, Dilu adheres to the resourcing-complementary principles in scheduling to improve GPU utilization with QoS guarantees. Third, Dilu adopts an adaptive 2D co-scaling method to enhance the elasticity of GPU provisioning in real time. Evaluations show that it can dynamically adjust the resourcing of various DL functions with low GPU fragmentation (10\%-46\% GPU defragmentation), high throughput (up to 1.8$\times$ inference and 1.1$\times$ training throughput increment) and QoS guarantees (11\%-71\% violation rate reduction), compared to the SOTA baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncoordinated Access to Serverless Computing in MEC Systems for IoT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00375v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Edge computing is a promising solution to enable low-latency IoT applications, by shifting computation from remote data centers to local devices, less powerful but closer to the end user devices. However, this creates the challenge on how to best assign clients to edge nodes offering compute capabilities. So far, two antithetical architectures are proposed: centralized resource orchestration or distributed overlay. In this work we explore a third way, called uncoordinated access, which consists in letting every device exploring multiple opportunities, to opportunistically embrace the heterogeneity of network and load conditions towards diverse edge nodes. In particular, our contribution is intended for emerging serverless IoT applications, which do not have a state on the edge nodes executing tasks. We model the proposed system as a set of M/M/1 queues and show that it achieves a smaller jitter delay than single edge node allocation. Furthermore, we compare uncoordinated access with state-of-the-art centralized and distributed alternatives in testbed experiments under more realistic conditions. Based on the results, our proposed approach, which requires a tiny fraction of the complexity of the alternatives in both the device and network components, is very effective in using the network resources, while incurring only a small penalty in terms of increased compute load and high percentiles of delay.</p></details> |  |
| **[AARC: Automated Affinity-aware Resource Configuration for Serverless Workflows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20846v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing is increasingly adopted for its ability to manage complex, event-driven workloads without the need for infrastructure provisioning. However, traditional resource allocation in serverless platforms couples CPU and memory, which may not be optimal for all functions. Existing decoupling approaches, while offering some flexibility, are not designed to handle the vast configuration space and complexity of serverless workflows. In this paper, we propose AARC, an innovative, automated framework that decouples CPU and memory resources to provide more flexible and efficient provisioning for serverless workloads. AARC is composed of two key components: Graph-Centric Scheduler, which identifies critical paths in workflows, and Priority Configurator, which applies priority scheduling techniques to optimize resource allocation. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that AARC achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with total search time reductions of 85.8% and 89.6%, and cost savings of 49.6% and 61.7%, respectively, while maintaining SLO compliance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 62nd Design Automation Conference (DAC 2025)</p></details> |
| **[It Takes Two to Tango: Serverless Workflow Serving via Bilaterally Engaged Resource Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14320v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless platforms typically adopt an early-binding approach for function sizing, requiring developers to specify an immutable size for each function within a workflow beforehand. Accounting for potential runtime variability, developers must size functions for worst-case scenarios to ensure service-level objectives (SLOs), resulting in significant resource inefficiency. To address this issue, we propose Janus, a novel resource adaptation framework for serverless platforms. Janus employs a late-binding approach, allowing function sizes to be dynamically adapted based on runtime conditions. The main challenge lies in the information barrier between the developer and the provider: developers lack access to runtime information, while providers lack domain knowledge about the workflow. To bridge this gap, Janus allows developers to provide hints containing rules and options for resource adaptation. Providers then follow these hints to dynamically adjust resource allocation at runtime based on real-time function execution information, ensuring compliance with SLOs. We implement Janus and conduct extensive experiments with real-world serverless workflows. Our results demonstrate that Janus enhances resource efficiency by up to 34.7% compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in the 39th IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS)</p></details> |
| **[KiSS: A Novel Container Size-Aware Memory Management Policy for Serverless in Edge-Cloud Continuum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12540v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing has revolutionized cloud architectures by enabling developers to deploy event-driven applications via lightweight, self-contained virtualized containers. However, serverless frameworks face critical cold-start challenges in resource-constrained edge environments, where traditional solutions fall short. The limitations are especially pronounced in edge environments, where heterogeneity and resource constraints exacerbate inefficiencies in resource utilization. This paper introduces KiSS (Keep it Separated Serverless), a static, container size-aware memory management policy tailored for the edge-cloud continuum. The design of KiSS is informed by a detailed workload analysis that identifies critical patterns in container size, invocation frequency, and memory contention. Guided by these insights, KiSS partitions memory pools into categories for small, frequently invoked containers and larger, resource-intensive ones, ensuring efficient resource utilization while minimizing cold starts and inter-function interference. Using a discrete-event simulator, we evaluate KiSS on edge-cluster environments with real-world-inspired workloads. Results show that KiSS reduces cold-start percentages by 60% and function drops by 56.5%, achieving significant performance gains in resource-constrained settings. This work underscores the importance of workload-driven design in advancing serverless efficiency at the edge.</p></details> |  |

To meet the critical Quality of Service (QoS) requirements such as reduced latency, efficient bandwidth usage, swift reaction times, scalability, privacy, and security serverless edge computing has emerged as a transformative paradigm. This systematic literature review explores the current landscape of serverless edge computing, analyzing recent studies to uncover the present state of this technology. The review identifies the essential features of serverless edge computing, focusing on architectural designs, QoS metrics, implementation specifics, practical applications, and communication modalities central to this paradigm. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes existing research efforts, providing a comparative analysis based on these classifications. The paper concludes with an in depth discussion of open research challenges and highlights promising future directions that hold potential for advancing serverless edge computing research.</p></details> | 20 pages,8 images |
| **[SCOPE: Performance Testing for Serverless Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01620v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing is a popular cloud computing paradigm that has found widespread adoption across various online workloads. It allows software engineers to develop cloud applications as a set of functions (called serverless functions). However, accurately measuring the performance (i.e., end-to-end response latency) of serverless functions is challenging due to the highly dynamic nature of the environment in which they run. To tackle this problem, a potential solution is to apply checks of performance testing techniques to determine how many repetitions of a given serverless function across a range of inputs are needed to cater to the performance fluctuation. However, the available literature lacks performance testing approaches designed explicitly for serverless computing. In this paper, we propose SCOPE, the first serverless computing-oriented performance testing approach. SCOPE takes into account the unique performance characteristics of serverless functions, such as their short execution durations and on-demand triggering. As such, SCOPE is designed as a fine-grained analysis approach. SCOPE incorporates the accuracy check and the consistency check to obtain the accurate and reliable performance of serverless functions. The evaluation shows that SCOPE provides testing results with 97.25% accuracy, 33.83 percentage points higher than the best currently available technique. Moreover, the superiority of SCOPE over the state-of-the-art holds on all functions that we study.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)</p></details> |

However, this generation has been limited to code snippets. Going one step further, our desideratum is to automatically generate architectural components. This would not only speed up development time, but would also enable us to eventually completely skip the development phase, moving directly from design decisions to deployment. To this end, we conduct an exploratory study on the capability of LLMs to generate architectural components for Functions as a Service (FaaS), commonly known as serverless functions. The small size of their architectural components make this architectural style amenable for generation using current LLMs compared to other styles like monoliths and microservices. We perform the study by systematically selecting open source serverless repositories, masking a serverless function and utilizing state of the art LLMs provided with varying levels of context information about the overall system to generate the masked function. We evaluate correctness through existing tests present in the repositories and use metrics from the Software Engineering (SE) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) domains to evaluate code quality and the degree of similarity between human and LLM generated code respectively. Along with our findings, we also present a discussion on the path forward for using GenAI in architectural component generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Software Architecture (ICSA) 2025 Main Track (https://conf.researchr.org/home/icsa-2025)</p></details> |
| **[SQUASH: Serverless and Distributed Quantization-based Attributed Vector Similarity Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01528v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vector similarity search presents significant challenges in terms of scalability for large and high-dimensional datasets, as well as in providing native support for hybrid queries. Serverless computing and cloud functions offer attractive benefits such as elasticity and cost-effectiveness, but are difficult to apply to data-intensive workloads. Jointly addressing these two main challenges, we present SQUASH, the first fully serverless vector search solution with rich support for hybrid queries. It features OSQ, an optimized and highly parallelizable quantization-based approach for vectors and attributes. Its segment-based storage mechanism enables significant compression in resource-constrained settings and offers efficient dimensional extraction operations. SQUASH performs a single distributed pass to guarantee the return of sufficiently many vectors satisfying the filter predicate, achieving high accuracy and avoiding redundant computation for vectors which fail the predicate. A multi-level search workflow is introduced to prune most vectors early to minimize the load on Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) instances. SQUASH is designed to identify and utilize retention of relevant data in re-used runtime containers, which eliminates redundant I/O and reduces costs. Finally, we demonstrate a new tree-based method for rapid FaaS invocation, enabling the bi-directional flow of data via request/response payloads. Experiments comparing SQUASH with state-of-the-art serverless vector search solutions and server-based baselines on vector search benchmarks confirm significant performance improvements at a lower cost.</p></details> |  |

Serverless computing offers a flexible alternative, enabling dynamic resource allocation and automatic scaling. This paper explores how serverless architectures can make large-scale ML inference tasks faster and cost-effective by decomposing monolithic processes into parallel functions. Through a case study on sentiment analysis using the DistilBERT model and the IMDb dataset, we demonstrate that serverless parallel processing can reduce execution time by over 95% compared to monolithic approaches, at the same cost.</p></details> |  |

Although modern data processing systems embrace serverless storage, such as Amazon S3, they continue to manage their compute resources as servers. This is challenging for unpredictable workloads, leaving clusters often underutilized. Recent research shows the potential of serverless compute resources, such as cloud functions, for elastic data processing, but also sees limitations in performance robustness and cost efficiency for long running workloads. These challenges require holistic approaches across the system stack. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no end-to-end data processing system built entirely on serverless infrastructure. In this paper, we present Skyrise, our effort towards building the first fully serverless SQL query processor. Skyrise exploits the elasticity of its underlying infrastructure, while alleviating the inherent limitations with a number of adaptive and cost-aware techniques. We show that both Skyrise's performance and cost are competitive to other cloud data systems for terabyte-scale queries of the analytical TPC-H benchmark.</p></details> |  |

However, existing platforms do not provide an upper bound for the billing model which makes the overall cost unpredictable, precluding many organizations from managing their budgets. Due to the diverse ranges of serverless functions and the heterogeneous capacity of edge devices, it is challenging to receive near-optimal solutions for deployment cost in a polynomial time. In this paper, we investigated the function scheduling problem with a budget constraint for serverless computing in wireless networks. Users and IoT devices are sending requests to edge nodes, improving the latency perceived by users. We propose two online scheduling algorithms based on reinforcement learning, incorporating several important characteristics of serverless functions. Via extensive simulations, we justify the superiority of the proposed algorithm by comparing with an ILP solver (Midaco). Our results indicate that the proposed algorithms efficiently approximate the results of Midaco within a factor of 1.03 while our decision-making time is 5 orders of magnitude less than that of Midaco.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE ICC 2025</p></details> |

Recent work proposed using domain-specific languages to express per-function policies, e.g., policies that enforce the allocation on nodes that enjoy lower latencies to databases and services used by the function. Here, we focus on affinity-aware scenarios, i.e., where, for performance and functional requirements, the allocation of a function depends on the presence/absence of other functions on nodes. We present aAPP, an extension of a declarative, platform-agnostic language that captures affinity-aware scheduling at the FaaS level. We implement an aAPP-based prototype on Apache OpenWhisk. Besides proving that a FaaS platform can capture affinity awareness using aAPP and improve performance in affinity-aware scenarios, we use our prototype to show that aAPP imposes no noticeable overhead in scenarios without affinity constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures, 1 listing. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2407.14159</p></details> |

While monolithic systems run fully on virtual servers, recent systems embrace cloud infrastructure and utilize the disaggregation of compute and storage to scale them independently. The introduction of serverless compute services, such as AWS Lambda, enables finer-grained and elastic scalability within these systems. Prior work shows the viability of serverless infrastructure for scalable data processing yet also sees limitations due to variable performance and cost overhead, in particular for networking and storage. In this paper, we perform a detailed analysis of the performance and cost characteristics of serverless infrastructure in the data processing context. We base our analysis on a large series of micro-benchmarks across different compute and storage services, as well as end-to-end workloads. To enable our analysis, we propose the Skyrise serverless evaluation platform. For the widely used serverless infrastructure of AWS, our analysis reveals distinct boundaries for performance variability in serverless networks and storage. We further present cost break-even points for serverless compute and storage. These insights provide guidance on when and how serverless infrastructure can be efficiently used for data processing.</p></details> |  |

Due to the highly dynamic execution environment, multiple identical runs of the same serverless function can yield different performance, specifically in terms of end-to-end response latency. However, surprisingly, our analysis of serverless computing-related papers published in top-tier conferences highlights that the research community lacks awareness of the performance variance problem, with only 38.38% of these papers employing multiple runs for quantifying it. To further investigate, we analyze the performance of 72 serverless functions collected from these papers. Our findings reveal that the performance of these serverless functions can differ by up to 338.76% (44.28% on average) across different runs. Moreover, 61.11% of these functions produce unreliable performance results, with a low number of repetitions commonly employed in the serverless computing literature. Our study highlights a lack of awareness in the serverless computing community regarding the well-known performance variance problem in software engineering. The empirical results illustrate the substantial magnitude of this variance, emphasizing that ignoring the variance can affect research reproducibility and result reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication in Empirical Software Engineering!</p></details> |

In practice, DTs require proper modeling, coherent development and seamless deployment along cloud and edge landscapes relying on established patterns to reduce operational costs. In this work, we propose KTWIN a Kubernetes-based Serverless Platform for Digital Twins. KTWIN was developed using the state-of-the-art open-source Cloud Native tools, allowing DT operators to easily define models through open standards and configure details of the underlying services and infrastructure. The experiments carried out with the developed prototype show that KTWIN can provide a higher level of abstraction to model and deploy a Digital Twin use case without compromising the solution scalability. The tests performed also show cost savings ranging between 60% and 80% compared to overprovisioned scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have been a dominant type of model architectures to enable large models nowadays, with parallel expert networks. Serving large MoE models on serverless computing is potentially beneficial, but has been underexplored due to substantial challenges in handling the skewed expert popularity and scatter-gather communication bottleneck in MoE model execution, for cost-efficient serverless MoE deployment and performance guarantee. We study optimized MoE model deployment and distributed inference serving on a serverless platform, that effectively predict expert selection, pipeline communication with model execution, and minimize the overall billed cost of serving MoE models. Especially, we propose a Bayesian optimization framework with multi-dimensional epsilon-greedy search to learn expert selections and optimal MoE deployment achieving optimal billed cost, including: 1) a Bayesian decision-making method for predicting expert popularity; 2) flexibly pipelined scatter-gather communication; and 3) an optimal model deployment algorithm for distributed MoE serving. Extensive experiments on AWS Lambda show that our designs reduce the billed cost of all MoE layers by at least 75.67% compared to CPU clusters while maintaining satisfactory inference throughput. As compared to LambdaML in serverless computing, our designs achieves 43.41% lower cost with a throughput decrease of at most 18.76%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shattering the Ephemeral Storage Cost Barrier for Data-Intensive Serverless Workflows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14821v2)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing is a popular cloud deployment paradigm where developers implement applications as workflows of functions that invoke each other. Cloud providers automatically scale function instances on demand and forward workflow requests to appropriate instances. However, current serverless clouds lack efficient cross-function data transfer, limiting the execution of data-intensive applications. Functions often rely on third-party services like AWS S3, AWS ElastiCache, or multi-tier solutions for intermediate data transfers, which introduces inefficiencies. We demonstrate that such through-storage transfers make data-intensive deployments economically impractical, with storage costs comprising more than 24-99% of the total serverless bill. To address this, we introduce Zipline, a fast, API-preserving data communication method for serverless platforms. Zipline enables direct function-to-function transfers, where the sender function buffers payloads in memory and sends a reference to the receiver. The receiver retrieves the data directly from the sender's memory, guided by the load balancer and autoscaler. Zipline integrates seamlessly with existing autoscaling, maintains invocation semantics, and eliminates the costs and overheads of intermediate services. We prototype Zipline in vHive/Knative on AWS EC2 nodes, demonstrating significant improvements. Zipline reduces costs and enhances latency and bandwidth compared to AWS S3 (the lowest-cost solution) and ElastiCache (the highest-performance solution). On real-world applications, Zipline lowers costs by 2-5x and reduces execution times by 1.3-3.4x versus S3. Compared to ElastiCache, Zipline achieves 17-772x cost reductions while improving performance by 2-5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>added...</summary><p>added cost reduction details</p></details> |

It allows cloud data warehouse (or lakehouse) users to focus on data analysis without the burden of managing systems and resources. Accordingly, in serverless query services, users become more concerned about cost-efficiency under acceptable performance than performance under fixed resources. This poses new challenges for serverless query engine design in providing flexible performance service-level agreements (SLAs) and cost-efficiency (i.e., prices). In this paper, we first define the problem of flexible performance SLAs and prices in serverless query processing and discuss its significance. Then, we envision the challenges and solutions for solving this problem and the opportunities it raises for other database research. Finally, we present PixelsDB, an open-source prototype with three service levels supported by dedicated architectural designs.

For users who are not system experts, serverless query processing greatly reduces the cost of owning a data analytic system. However, it is still a significant challenge for non-expert users to transform their complex and evolving data analytic needs into proper SQL queries and select a serverless query service that delivers satisfactory performance and price for each type of query. This paper presents PixelsDB, an open-source data analytic system that allows users who lack system or SQL expertise to explore data efficiently. It allows users to generate and debug SQL queries using a natural language interface powered by fine-tuned language models. The queries are then executed by a serverless query engine that offers varying prices for different performance service levels (SLAs). The performance SLAs are natively supported by dedicated architecture design and heterogeneous resource scheduling that can apply cost-efficient resources to process non-urgent queries. We demonstrate that the combination of a serverless paradigm, a natural-language-aided interface, and flexible SLAs and prices will substantially improve the usability of cloud data analytic systems.</p></details> | 4 pages, 4 figures |

To address this issue, we propose Frenzy, a memory-aware serverless computing method for heterogeneous GPU clusters. Frenzy allows users to submit models without worrying about underlying hardware resources. First, Frenzy predicts the required number and type of GPUs by estimating the GPU memory usage of the LLM. Then, it employs a low-overhead heterogeneity-aware scheduling method to optimize training efficiency. We validated Frenzy's performance by conducting multi-task LLM training tests on a heterogeneous GPU cluster with three different GPU types. The results show that Frenzy's memory usage prediction accuracy exceeds 92\%, the scheduling overhead is reduced by 10 times, and it reduces the average job completion time by 12\% to 18\% compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing cloud-based model inference systems are costly, not easy to scale, and must be trusted in handling the models and user request data. Serverless computing presents a new opportunity, as it provides elasticity and fine-grained pricing. Our goal is to design a serverless model inference system that protects models and user request data from untrusted cloud providers. It offers high performance and low cost, while requiring no intrusive changes to the current serverless platforms. To realize our goal, we leverage trusted hardware. We identify and address three challenges in using trusted hardware for serverless model inference. These challenges arise from the high-level abstraction of serverless computing, the performance overhead of trusted hardware, and the characteristics of model inference workloads. We present SeSeMI, a secure, efficient, and cost-effective serverless model inference system. It adds three novel features non-intrusively to the existing serverless infrastructure and nothing else.The first feature is a key service that establishes secure channels between the user and the serverless instances, which also provides access control to models and users' data. The second is an enclave runtime that allows one enclave to process multiple concurrent requests. The final feature is a model packer that allows multiple models to be executed by one serverless instance. We build SeSeMI on top of Apache OpenWhisk, and conduct extensive experiments with three popular machine learning models. The results show that SeSeMI achieves low latency and low cost at scale for realistic workloads.</p></details> |  |
| **[Raptor: Distributed Scheduling for Serverless Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16457v2)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To support parallelizable serverless workflows in applications like media processing, we have prototyped a distributed scheduler called Raptor that reduces both the end-to-end delay time and failure rate of parallelizable serverless workflows. As modern serverless frameworks are typically deployed to extremely large scale distributed computing environments by major cloud providers, Raptor is specifically designed to exploit the property of statistically independent function execution that tends to emerge at very large scales. To demonstrate the effect of horizontal scale on function execution, our evaluation demonstrates that mean delay time improvements provided by Raptor for RSA public-private key pair generation can be accurately predicted by mutually independent exponential random variables, but only once the serverless framework is deployed in a highly available configuration and horizontally scaled across three availability zones.</p></details> |  |
| **[GoldFish: Serverless Actors with Short-Term Memory State for the Edge-Cloud Continuum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02867v1)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless Computing is a computing paradigm that provides efficient infrastructure management and elastic scalability. Serverless functions scale up or down based on demand, which means that functions are not directly addressable and rely on platform-managed invocation. Serverless stateless nature requires functions to leverage external services, such as object storage and KVS, to exchange data. Serverless actors have emerged as a solution to these issues. However, the state-of-the-art serverless lifecycle and event-trigger invocation force actors to leverage remote services to manage their state and exchange data, which impacts the performance and incurs additional costs and dependency on third-party services. To address these issues, in this paper, we introduce a novel serverless lifecycle model that allows short-term stateful actors, enabling actors to maintain their state between executions. Additionally, we propose a novel serverless Invocation Model that enables serverless actors to influence the processing of future messages. We present GoldFish, a lightweight WebAssembly short-term stateful serverless actor platform that provides a novel serverless actor lifecycle and invocation model. GoldFish leverages WebAssembly to provide the actors with lightweight sandbox isolation, making them suitable for the Edge-Cloud Continuum, where computational resources are limited. Experimental results show that GoldFish optimizes the data exchange latency by up to 92% and increases the throughput by up to 10x compared to OpenFaaS and Spin.</p></details> | <details><summary>14th ...</summary><p>14th International Conference on the Internet of Things (IoT 2024), November 19--22, 2024, Oulu, Finland</p></details> |

However, the complexity and dynamic nature of serverless applications present significant challenges to ensure system availability and performance. There are many root cause analysis (RCA) methods for microservice systems, but they are not suitable for precise modeling serverless applications. This is because: (1) Compared to microservice, serverless applications exhibit a highly dynamic nature. They have short lifecycle and only generate instantaneous pulse-like data, lacking long-term continuous information. (2) Existing methods solely focus on analyzing the running stage and overlook other stages, failing to encompass the entire lifecycle of serverless applications. To address these limitations, we propose FaaSRCA, a full lifecycle root cause analysis method for serverless applications. It integrates multi-modal observability data generated from platform and application side by using Global Call Graph. We train a Graph Attention Network (GAT) based graph auto-encoder to compute reconstruction scores for the nodes in global call graph. Based on the scores, we determine the root cause at the granularity of the lifecycle stage of serverless functions. We conduct experimental evaluations on two serverless benchmarks, the results show that FaaSRCA outperforms other baseline methods with a top-k precision improvement ranging from 21.25% to 81.63%.</p></details> | issre 2024 |

However, building and running data-intensive serverless workflows also brings new challenges that can significantly degrade the application performance. Cold start remains one of the main challenges that impact the total function execution time. Further, since the serverless functions are not directly addressable, Serverless workflows need to rely on external (storage) services to pass the input data to the downstream functions. Empirical evidence from our experiments shows that the cold start and the function data passing take up the most time in the function execution lifecycle. In this paper, we introduce Truffle - a novel model and architecture that enables efficient inter-function data passing in the Edge-Cloud Continuum by introducing mechanisms that separate computation and I/O, allowing serverless functions to leverage the cold starts to their advantage. Truffle introduces Smart Data Prefetch (SDP) mechanism that abstracts the retrieval of input data for the serverless functions by triggering the data retrieval from the external storage during the function's startup. Truffle's Cold Start Pass (CSP) mechanism optimizes inter-function data passing and data exchange within serverless workflows in the Edge-Cloud Continuum by hooking into the functions' scheduling lifecycle to trigger early data passing during the function's cold start. Experimental results show that by leveraging the data prefetching and cold-start data passing, Truffle reduces the IO latency impact on the total function execution time by up to 77%, improving the function execution time by up to 46% compared to the state-of-the-art data passing approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>The I...</summary><p>The IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC 2024)</p></details> |

It particularly reviews the ServerlessLLM method, a system designed to address the cold start problem in serverless inference for large language models. Traditional serverless approaches struggle with high latency due to the size of LLM checkpoints and the overhead of initializing GPU resources. ServerlessLLM introduces a multitier checkpoint loading system, leveraging underutilized GPU memory and storage to reduce startup times by 6--8x compared to existing methods. It also proposes live inference migration and a startup-time-optimized model scheduler, ensuring efficient resource allocation and minimizing delays. This system significantly improves performance and scalability in serverless environments for LLM workloads. Besides ServerlessLLM, several other methods from recent research literature, including Rainbowcake, are reviewed in this paper.

In order to provide strong multi-tenant isolation, FaaS providers commonly sandbox functions inside virtual machines (VMs or microVMs). While compute resources assigned to VM-sandboxed functions can be seamlessly adjusted on the fly, memory elasticity remains challenging, especially when scaling down. State-of-the-art mechanisms for VM memory elasticity suffer from increased reclaim latency when memory needs to be released, compounded by CPU and memory bandwidth overheads. We identify the obliviousness of the Linux memory manager to the virtually hotplugged memory as the key issue hindering hot-unplug performance, and design HotMem, a novel approach for fast and efficient VM memory hot(un)plug, targeting VM-sandboxed serverless functions. Our key insight is that by segregating virtually hotplugged memory regions from regular VM memory, we are able to bound the lifetimes of allocations within these regions thus enabling their fast and efficient reclamation. We implement HotMem in Linux v6.6 and our evaluation shows that it is an order of magnitude faster than state-of-practice to reclaim VM memory, while achieving the same P99 function latency with a model that statically over-provisions VMs.</p></details> |  |

However, this shift introduces new responsibilities and necessitates a distinct set of skills for practitioners. This study aims to identify and organize the industry requirements for serverless practitioners by conducting a qualitative analysis of 141 job advertisements from seven countries. We developed comprehensive taxonomies of roles, responsibilities, and skills, categorizing 19 responsibilities into four themes: software development, infrastructure and operations, professional development and leadership, and software business. Additionally, we identified 28 hard skills mapped into seven themes and 32 soft skills mapped into eight themes, with the six most demanded soft skills being communication proficiency, continuous learning and adaptability, collaborative teamwork, problem-solving and analytical skills, leadership excellence, and project management. Our findings contribute to understanding the organizational structures and training requirements for effective serverless computing adoption.</p></details> |  |

Deploying functions is mutually profitable: users need not be concerned with resource management, while providers can keep their servers at high utilization rates running thousands of functions concurrently on a single machine. It is exactly this high concurrency that comes at a cost. The standard Linux Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) switches often between tasks, which leads to prolonged execution times. We present evidence that relying on the default Linux CFS scheduler increases serverless workloads cost by up to 10X. In this article, we raise awareness and make a case for rethinking the OS-level scheduling in Linux for serverless workloads composed of many short-lived processes. To make serverless more affordable we introduce a hybrid two-level scheduling approach that relies on FaaS characteristics. Short-running functions are executed in FIFO fashion without preemption, while longer-running functions are passed to CFS after a certain time period. We show that tailor-made OS scheduling is able to significantly reduce user-facing costs without adding any provider-facing overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Middleware 2024, author draft made available for timely dissemination</p></details> |

It features serverless attributes by eliminating resource management responsibilities from developers, and offers transparent and on-demand scalability of applications. To provide seamless on-demand scalability, new function instances are prepared to serve the incoming workload in the absence or unavailability of function instances. However, FaaS platforms are known to suffer from cold starts, where this function provisioning process introduces a non-negligible delay in function response and reduces the end-user experience. Therefore, the presented work focuses on reducing the frequent, on-demand cold starts on the platform by using Reinforcement Learning(RL). The proposed approach uses model-free Q-learning that consider function metrics such as CPU utilization, existing function instances, and response failure rate, to proactively initialize functions, in advance, based on the expected demand. The proposed solution is implemented on Kubeless and evaluated using an open-source function invocation trace applied to a matrix multiplication function. The evaluation results demonstrate a favourable performance of the RL-based agent when compared to Kubeless' default policy and a function keep-alive policy by improving throughput by up to 8.81% and reducing computation load and resource wastage by up to 55% and 37%, respectively, that is a direct outcome of reduced cold starts.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 fi...</summary><p>13 figures, 24 pages, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, right-sizing the function memory force developers to speculate performance and make ad-hoc configuration decisions. Recent research has highlighted that a function's input characteristics, such as input size, type and number of inputs, significantly impact its resource demand, run-time performance and costs with fluctuating workloads. This correlation further makes memory configuration a non-trivial task. On that account, an input-aware function memory allocator not only improves developer productivity by completely hiding resource-related decisions but also drives an opportunity to reduce resource wastage and offer a finer-grained cost-optimised pricing scheme. Therefore, we present MemFigLess, a serverless solution that estimates the memory requirement of a serverless function with input-awareness. The framework executes function profiling in an offline stage and trains a multi-output Random Forest Regression model on the collected metrics to invoke input-aware optimal configurations. We evaluate our work with the state-of-the-art approaches on AWS Lambda service to find that MemFigLess is able to capture the input-aware resource relationships and allocate upto 82% less resources and save up to 87% run-time costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 tables, 28 figures, accepted conference paper - UCC'24</p></details> |

However, existing data-passing solutions for serverless computing primarily reply on host memory for fast data transfer, mandating substantial data movement and resulting in salient I/O overhead. In this paper, we present FaaSTube, a GPU-efficient data passing system for serverless inference. FaaSTube manages intermediate data within a GPU memory pool to facilitate direct data exchange between GPU functions. It enables fine-grained bandwidth sharing over PCIe and NVLink, minimizing data-passing latency for both host-to-GPU and GPU-to-GPU while providing performance isolation between functions. Additionally, FaaSTube implements an elastic GPU memory pool that dynamically scales to accommodate varying data-passing demands. Evaluations on real-world applications show that FaaSTube reduces end-to-end latency by up to 90\% and achieves up to 12x higher throughput compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Based Misconfiguration Detection for AWS Serverless Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00642v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing is an emerging cloud computing paradigm that enables developers to build applications at the function level, known as serverless applications. Amazon Web Services (AWS), the leading provider in this domain, provides the Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM), the most widely adopted configuration schema for configuring and managing serverless applications through a specified file. However, misconfigurations pose a significant challenge in serverless development. Traditional data-driven techniques may struggle with serverless applications because the complexity of serverless configurations hinders pattern recognition, and it is challenging to gather complete datasets that cover all possible configurations. Leveraging vast amounts of publicly available data during pre-training, LLMs can have the potential to assist in identifying and explaining misconfigurations in serverless applications. In this paper, we introduce SlsDetector, the first framework leveraging LLMs to detect misconfigurations in serverless applications. SlsDetector utilizes effective prompt engineering with zero-shot learning to identify configuration issues. It designs multi-dimensional constraints specifically tailored to the configuration characteristics of serverless applications and leverages the Chain of Thought technique to enhance LLMs inferences. We evaluate SlsDetector on a curated dataset of 110 configuration files. Our results show that SlsDetector, based on ChatGPT-4o, achieves a precision of 72.88%, recall of 88.18%, and F1-score of 79.75%, outperforming state-of-the-art data-driven approaches by 53.82, 17.40, and 49.72 percentage points, respectively. Furthermore, we investigate the generalization capability of SlsDetector by applying recent LLMs, including Llama 3.1 (405B) Instruct Turbo and Gemini 1.5 Pro, with results showing consistently high effectiveness across these models.</p></details> |  |
| **[An approach to provide serverless scientific pipelines within the context of SKA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09728v2)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is a type of serverless computing that allows developers to write and deploy code as individual functions, which can be triggered by specific events or requests. FaaS platforms automatically manage the underlying infrastructure, scaling it up or down as needed, being highly scalable, cost-effective and offering a high level of abstraction. Prototypes being developed within the SKA Regional Center Network (SRCNet) are exploring models for data distribution, software delivery and distributed computing with the goal of moving and executing computation to where the data is. Since SKA will be the largest data producer on the planet, it will be necessary to distribute this massive volume of data to the SRCNet nodes that will serve as a hub for computing and analysis operations on the closest data. Within this context, in this work we want to validate the feasibility of designing and deploying functions and applications commonly used in radio interferometry workflows within a FaaS platform to demonstrate the value of this computing model as an alternative to explore for data processing in the distributed nodes of the SRCNet. We have analyzed several FaaS platforms and successfully deployed one of them, where we have imported several functions using two different methods: microfunctions from the CASA framework, which are written in Python code, and highly specific native applications like wsclean. Therefore, we have designed a simple catalogue that can be easily scaled to provide all the key features of FaaS in highly distributed environments using orchestrators, as well as having the ability to integrate them with workflows or APIs. This paper contributes to the ongoing discussion of the potential of FaaS models for scientific data processing, particularly in the context of large-scale, distributed projects such as SKA.</p></details> | 6 |
| **[Histrio: a Serverless Actor System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21793v1)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the serverless paradigm has been widely adopted to develop cloud applications, as it enables building scalable solutions while delegating operational concerns such as infrastructure management and resource provisioning to the serverless provider. Despite bringing undisputed advantages, the serverless model requires a change in programming paradigm that may add complexity in software development. In particular, in the Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) paradigm, functions are inherently stateless. As a consequence, developers carry the burden of directly interacting with external storage services and handling concurrency and state consistency across function invocations. This results in less time spent on solving the actual business problems they face. Moving from these premises, this paper proposes Histrio, a programming model and execution environment that simplifies the development of complex stateful applications in the FaaS paradigm. Histrio grounds on the actor programming model, and lifts concerns such as state management, database interaction, and concurrency handling from developers. It enriches the actor model with features that simplify and optimize the interaction with external storage. It guarantees exactly-once-processing consistency, meaning that the application always behaves as if any interaction with external clients was processed once and only once, masking failures. Histrio has been compared with a classical FaaS implementation to evaluate both the development time saved due to the guarantees the system offers and the applicability of Histrio in typical applications. In the evaluated scenarios, Histrio simplified the implementation by significantly removing the amount of code needed to handle operational concerns. It proves to be scalable and it provides configuration mechanisms to trade performance and execution costs.</p></details> |  |

These compact and robust hardware units bring the power of AI processing directly to the source of data--on the edge of the network. On the other hand, on-demand serverless inference services are becoming more and more popular as they minimize the infrastructural cost associated with hosting and running DNN models for small to medium-sized businesses. However, these computing devices are still constrained in terms of resource availability. As such, the service providers need to load and unload models efficiently in order to meet the growing demand. In this paper, we introduce FusedInf to efficiently swap DNN models for on-demand serverless inference services on the edge. FusedInf combines multiple models into a single Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) to efficiently load the models into the GPU memory and make execution faster. Our evaluation of popular DNN models showed that creating a single DAG can make the execution of the models up to 14\% faster while reducing the memory requirement by up to 17\%. The prototype implementation is available at https://github.com/SifatTaj/FusedInf.</p></details> |  |

In serverless computing, users only pay for the time they actually use resources, enabling zero scaling to optimise cost and resource utilisation. However, this approach also introduces the serverless cold start problem. Researchers have developed various solutions to address the cold start problem, yet it remains an unresolved research area. In this article, we propose a systematic literature review on clod start latency in serverless computing. Furthermore, we create a detailed taxonomy of approaches to cold start latency, which we use to investigate existing techniques for reducing the cold start time and frequency. We have classified the current studies on cold start latency into several categories such as caching and application-level optimisation-based solutions, as well as Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML)-based solutions. Moreover, we have analyzed the impact of cold start latency on quality of service, explored current cold start latency mitigation methods, datasets, and implementation platforms, and classified them into categories based on their common characteristics and features. Finally, we outline the open challenges and highlight the possible future directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint Version Accepted for Publication in ACM Computing Survey, 2024</p></details> |

Their abundance and low orbits allow for low latency communication with a satellite almost anywhere on Earth, and high-speed inter-satellite laser links~(ISLs) enable a quick exchange of large amounts of data among satellites. As the computational capabilities of LEO satellites grow, they are becoming eligible as general-purpose compute nodes. In the 3D continuum, which combines Cloud and Edge nodes on Earth and satellites in space into a seamless computing fabric, workloads can be executed on any of the aforementioned compute nodes, depending on where it is most beneficial. However, scheduling on LEO satellites moving at approx. 27,000 km/h requires picking the satellite with the lowest latency to all data sources (ground and, possibly, earth observation satellites). Dissipating heat from onboard hardware is challenging when facing the sun and workloads must not drain the satellite's batteries. These factors make meeting SLOs more challenging than in the Edge-Cloud continuum, i.e., on Earth alone. We present HyperDrive, an SLO-aware scheduler for serverless functions specifically designed for the 3D continuum. It places functions on Cloud, Edge, or Space compute nodes, based on their availability and ability to meet the SLO requirements of the workflow. We evaluate HyperDrive using a wildfire disaster response use case with high Earth Observation data processing requirements and stringent SLOs, showing that it enables the design and execution of such next-generation 3D scenarios with 71% lower network latency than the best baseline scheduler.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 IEEE/ACM Symposium on Edge Computing(SEC)</p></details> |

Developers, however, still need to partition their applications into FaaS functions, which is error-prone and complex: Encapsulating only the smallest logical unit of an application as a FaaS function maximizes flexibility and reusability. Yet, it also leads to invocation overheads, additional cold starts, and may increase cost due to double billing during synchronous invocations. Conversely, deploying an entire application as a single FaaS function avoids these overheads but decreases flexibility. In this paper we present Fusionize, a framework that automates optimizing for this trade-off by automatically fusing application code into an optimized multi-function composition. Developers only need to write fine-grained application code following the serverless model, while Fusionize automatically fuses different parts of the application into FaaS functions, manages their interactions, and configures the underlying infrastructure. At runtime, it monitors application performance and adapts it to minimize request-response latency and costs. Real-world use cases show that Fusionize can improve the deployment artifacts of the application, reducing both median request-response latency and cost of an example IoT application by more than 35%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Author copy of article accepted in IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing with DOI 10.1109/TCC.2024.3451108</p></details> |

The serverless computing model provides an intuitive interface for developing cloud-based applications, where the development and deployment of scalable microservices has become easier and cost-effective. An increasing number of batch-processing applications are deployed as pipelines that comprise a sequence of functions that must meet their deadline targets to be practical. In this paper, we present our Hybrid Cloud Scheduler (HCS) for orchestrating the execution of serverless batch-processing pipelines deployed over heterogeneous infrastructures. Our framework enables developers to (i) automatically schedule and execute batch-processing applications in heterogeneous environments such as the private edge and public cloud serverless infrastructures, (ii) benefit from cost reduction through the utilization of their own resources in a private cluster, and (iii) significantly improves the probability of meeting the deadline requirements of their applications.

The serverless computing model offers an intuitive, event-based interface that makes the development and deployment of scalable cloud-based applications easier and cost-effective. An important aspect that has not been examined in these systems is their energy consumption during the application execution. One way to deal with this issue is to schedule the function invocations in an energy-efficient way. However, efficient scheduling of applications in a multi-tenant environment, like FaaS systems, poses significant challenges. The trade-off between the server's energy usage and the hosted functions' performance requirements needs to be taken into consideration. In this work, we propose an Energy Efficient Scheduler for orchestrating the execution of serverless functions so that it minimizes energy consumption while it satisfies the applications' performance demands. Our approach considers real-time performance measurements and historical data and applies a novel DVFS technique to minimize energy consumption. Our detailed experimental evaluation using realistic workloads on our local cluster illustrates the working and benefits of our approach.</p></details> |  |

In fact, they involve a large number of heterogeneous microservices that also include third-party software. As a result, security vulnerabilities are hard to identify and mitigate before they start being actively exploited by attackers. For this reason, governments have recently introduced cybersecurity regulations that require vendors to share a software bill of material (SBOM) with end users or regulators. An SBOM can be employed to identify the security vulnerabilities of a software component even without access to its source code, as long as it is accurate and interoperable across different tools. This work evaluates this issue through a comprehensive study of tools for SBOM generation and vulnerability scanning, including both open-source software and cloud services from major providers. We specifically target software containers and focus on operating system packages in Linux distributions that are widely used as base images due to their far-reaching security impact. Our findings show that the considered tools are largely incompatible, leading to inaccurate reporting and a large amount of undetected vulnerabilities. We uncover the SBOM confusion vulnerability, a byproduct of such fragmented ecosystem, where inconsistent formats prevent reliable vulnerability detection across tools.</p></details> |  |

While container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes help optimize workload scheduling to reduce carbon emissions, existing methods often depend on centralized machine learning models that raise privacy concerns and struggle to generalize across diverse environments. In this paper, we propose a federated learning approach for energy consumption prediction that preserves data privacy by keeping sensitive operational data within individual enterprises. By extending the Kubernetes Efficient Power Level Exporter (Kepler), our framework trains XGBoost models collaboratively across distributed clients using Flower's FedXgbBagging aggregation using a bagging strategy, eliminating the need for centralized data sharing.

| **[Optimizing Container Loading and Unloading through Dual-Cycling and Dockyard Rehandle Reduction Using a Hybrid Genetic Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08534v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the NP-hard problem of optimizing container handling at ports by integrating Quay Crane Dual-Cycling (QCDC) and dockyard rehandle minimization. We realized that there are interdependencies between the unloading sequence of QCDC and the dockyard plan and propose the Quay Crane Dual Cycle - Dockyard Rehandle Genetic Algorithm (QCDC-DR-GA), a hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) that holistically optimizes both aspects: maximizing the number of Dual Cycles (DCs) and minimizing the number of dockyard rehandles. QCDC-DR-GA employs specialized crossover and mutation strategies. Extensive experiments on various ship sizes demonstrate that QCDC-DR-GA reduces total operation time by 15-20% for large ships compared to existing methods. Statistical validation via two-tailed paired t-tests confirms significant improvements at a 5% significance level. The results underscore the inefficiency of isolated optimization and highlight the critical need for integrated algorithms in port operations. This approach increases resource utilization and operational efficiency, offering a cost-effective solution for ports to decrease turnaround times without infrastructure investments.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Benchmark Study of Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for the Container Stowage Planning Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02589v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Container stowage planning (CSPP) is a critical component of maritime transportation and terminal operations, directly affecting supply chain efficiency. Owing to its complexity, CSPP has traditionally relied on human expertise. While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been applied to CSPP, systematic benchmark comparisons across different algorithms remain limited. To address this gap, we develop a Gym environment that captures the fundamental features of CSPP and extend it to include crane scheduling in both multi-agent and single-agent formulations. Within this framework, we evaluate five RL algorithms: DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, and TRPO under multiple scenarios of varying complexity. The results reveal distinct performance gaps with increasing complexity, underscoring the importance of algorithm choice and problem formulation for CSPP. Overall, this paper benchmarks multiple RL methods for CSPP while providing a reusable Gym environment with crane scheduling, thus offering a foundation for future research and practical deployment in maritime logistics.</p></details> |  |
| **[gh0stEdit: Exploiting Layer-Based Access Vulnerability Within Docker Container Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08218v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Containerisation is a popular deployment process for application-level virtualisation using a layer-based approach. Docker is a leading provider of containerisation, and through the Docker Hub, users can supply Docker images for sharing and re-purposing popular software application containers. Using a combination of in-built inspection commands, publicly displayed image layer content, and static image scanning, Docker images are designed to ensure end users can clearly assess the content of the image before running them. In this paper we present gh0stEdit, an exploit that fundamentally undermines the integrity of Docker images and subverts the assumed trust and transparency they utilise. The use of gh0stEdit allows an attacker to maliciously edit Docker images, in a way that is not shown within the image history, hierarchy or commands. This attack can also be carried out against signed images (Docker Content Trust) without invalidating the image signature. We present a detailed case study for this exploit, and showcase how gh0stEdit is able to poison an image in a way that is not picked up through static or dynamic scanning tools. We highlight the issues in the current approach to Docker image security and trust, and expose an attack method which could potentially be exploited in the wild without being detected. To the best of our knowledge we are the first to provide detailed discussion on the exploit of this vulnerability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Direct Token Optimization: A Self-contained Approach to Large Language Model Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00125v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning is an emerging technique that removes the influence of a subset of training data (forget set) from a model without full retraining, with applications including privacy protection, content moderation, and model correction. The key challenge lies in ensuring that the model completely forgets the knowledge of the forget set without compromising its overall utility. Existing unlearning methods for large language models (LLMs) often utilize auxiliary language models, retain datasets, or even commercial AI services for effective unlearning and maintaining the model utility. However, dependence on these external resources is often impractical and could potentially introduce additional privacy risks. In this work, we propose direct token optimization (DTO), a novel self-contained unlearning approach for LLMs that directly optimizes the token level objectives and eliminates the need for external resources. Given a sequence to unlearn, we identify two categories of tokens: target tokens, which capture critical knowledge for unlearning, and the remaining non-target tokens, which are crucial for maintaining the model utility. The former are used to optimize the unlearning objective, while the latter serve to preserve the model's performance. The experimental results show that the proposed DTO achieves up to 16.8$\times$ improvement in forget quality on several benchmark datasets than the latest baselines while maintaining a comparable level of model utility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Monoid Structures on Indexed Containers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25879v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Containers represent a wide class of type constructions relevant for functional programming and (co)inductive reasoning. Indexed containers generalize this notion to better fit the scope of dependently typed programming. When interpreting types to be sets, a container describes an endofunctor on the category of sets while an I-indexed container describes an endofunctor on the category Set^I of I-indexed families of sets. We consider the monoidal structure on the category of I-indexed containers whose tensor product of containers describes the composition of the respective induced endofunctors. We then give a combinatorial characterization of monoids in this monoidal category, and we show how these monoids correspond precisely to monads on the induced endofunctors on Set^I. Lastly, we conclude by presenting some examples of monads on Set^I that fall under our characterization, including the product of two monads, indexed variants of the state and the writer monads and an example of a free monad. The technical results of this work are accompanied by a formalization in the proof assistant Cubical Agda.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings LSFA 2025, arXiv:2509.23739</p></details> |
| **[Resource Management Schemes for Cloud-Native Platforms with Computing Containers of Docker and Kubernetes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10350v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Businesses have made increasing adoption and incorporation of cloud technology into internal processes in the last decade. The cloud-based deployment provides on-demand availability without active management. More recently, the concept of cloud-native application has been proposed and represents an invaluable step toward helping organizations develop software faster and update it more frequently to achieve dramatic business outcomes. Cloud-native is an approach to build and run applications that exploit the cloud computing delivery model's advantages. It is more about how applications are created and deployed than where. The container-based virtualization technology, such as Docker and Kubernetes, serves as the foundation for cloud-native applications. This paper investigates the performance of two popular computational-intensive applications, big data, and deep learning, in a cloud-native environment. We analyze the system overhead and resource usage for these applications. Through extensive experiments, we show that the completion time reduces by up to 79.4% by changing the default setting and increases by up to 96.7% due to different resource management schemes on two platforms. Additionally, the resource release is delayed by up to 116.7% across different systems. Our work can guide developers, administrators, and researchers to better design and deploy their applications by selecting and configuring a hosting platform.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Fine-Grained Reasoning About Container-Internal Pointers with Logical Pinning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23229v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most separation logics hide container-internal pointers for modularity. This makes it difficult to specify container APIs that temporarily expose those pointers to the outside, and to verify programs that use these APIs. We present logical pinning, a lightweight borrowing model for sequential programs that allows users to selectively track container-internal pointers at the logical level. Our model generalizes the magic-wand operator, making it easy to write and prove precise specifications, including pointer-stability properties. Because it only changes how representation predicates and specifications are written, our approach is compatible with most separation logic variants. We demonstrate the practicality of logical pinning by verifying small but representative pointer-manipulating programs, and deriving more precise versions of common container specifications. In doing so, we show that our approach subsumes some well-known proof patterns, simplifies some complex proofs, and enables reasoning about program patterns not supported by traditional specifications. All of our results are mechanized in the Rocq proof assistant, using the CFML library.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parameterized Hardness of Zonotope Containment and Neural Network Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22849v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks with ReLU activations are a widely used model in machine learning. It is thus important to have a profound understanding of the properties of the functions computed by such networks. Recently, there has been increasing interest in the (parameterized) computational complexity of determining these properties. In this work, we close several gaps and resolve an open problem posted by Froese et al. [COLT '25] regarding the parameterized complexity of various problems related to network verification. In particular, we prove that deciding positivity (and thus surjectivity) of a function $f\colon\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$ computed by a 2-layer ReLU network is W[1]-hard when parameterized by $d$. This result also implies that zonotope (non-)containment is W[1]-hard with respect to $d$, a problem that is of independent interest in computational geometry, control theory, and robotics. Moreover, we show that approximating the maximum within any multiplicative factor in 2-layer ReLU networks, computing the $L_p$-Lipschitz constant for $p\in(0,\infty]$ in 2-layer networks, and approximating the $L_p$-Lipschitz constant in 3-layer networks are NP-hard and W[1]-hard with respect to $d$. Notably, our hardness results are the strongest known so far and imply that the naive enumeration-based methods for solving these fundamental problems are all essentially optimal under the Exponential Time Hypothesis.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |

To address the issues of distributed decisions in cloud-edge environments, we present TD3-Sched, a distributed reinforcement learning (DRL) scheduler based on Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) for continuous control of CPU and memory allocation, which can achieve optimized decisions for resource provisioning under dynamic workloads. On a realistic cloud-edge testbed with SockShop application and Alibaba traces, TD3-Sched achieves reductions of 17.9% to 38.6% in latency under same loads compared with other reinforcement-learning and rule-based baselines, and 16% to 31.6% under high loads. TD3-Sched also shows superior Service Level Objective (SLO) compliance with only 0.47% violations. These results indicate faster convergence, lower latency, and more stable performance while preserving service quality in container-based cloud-edge environment compared with the baselines.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

While cutting-edge methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excel in typical scenes, their performance deteriorates in the presence of mirrors. Existing solutions mainly focus on handling mirror surfaces through symmetry mapping but often overlook the rich information carried by mirror reflections. These reflections offer complementary perspectives that can fill in absent details and significantly enhance reconstruction quality. To advance 3D reconstruction in mirror-rich environments, we present MirrorScene3D, a comprehensive dataset featuring diverse indoor scenes, 1256 high-quality images, and annotated mirror masks, providing a benchmark for evaluating reconstruction methods in reflective settings. Building on this, we propose ReflectiveGS, an extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting that utilizes mirror reflections as complementary viewpoints rather than simple symmetry artifacts, enhancing scene geometry and recovering absent details. Experiments on MirrorScene3D show that ReflectiveGaussian outperforms existing methods in SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, and training speed, setting a new benchmark for 3D reconstruction in mirror-rich environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[XaaS Containers: Performance-Portable Representation With Source and IR Containers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17914v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-performance computing (HPC) systems and cloud data centers are converging, and containers are becoming the default method of portable software deployment. Yet, while containers simplify software management, they face significant performance challenges in HPC environments as they must sacrifice hardware-specific optimizations to achieve portability. Although HPC containers can use runtime hooks to access optimized MPI libraries and GPU devices, they are limited by application binary interface (ABI) compatibility and cannot overcome the effects of early-stage compilation decisions. Acceleration as a Service (XaaS) proposes a vision of performance-portable containers, where a containerized application should achieve peak performance across all HPC systems. We present a practical realization of this vision through Source and Intermediate Representation (IR) containers, where we delay performance-critical decisions until the target system specification is known. We analyze specialization mechanisms in HPC software and propose a new LLM-assisted method for automatic discovery of specializations. By examining the compilation pipeline, we develop a methodology to build containers optimized for target architectures at deployment time. Our prototype demonstrates that new XaaS containers combine the convenience of containerization with the performance benefits of system-specialized builds.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis (SC'25)</p></details> |
| **[A High-performance Real-time Container File Monitoring Approach Based on Virtual Machine Introspection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16030v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As cloud computing continues to advance and become an integral part of modern IT infrastructure, container security has emerged as a critical factor in ensuring the smooth operation of cloud-native applications. An attacker can attack the service in the container or even perform the container escape attack by tampering with the files. Monitoring container files is important for APT detection and cyberspace security. Existing file monitoring methods are usually based on host operating system or virtual machine introspection to protect file security in real time. The methods based on the host operating system usually monitor file operations in the host operating system. However, when the container escapes to the host, the host operating system will no longer be secure, so these methods face the problem of weak security. Aiming at the problems of low security and high overload introduced in existing container file monitoring, a high-performance container file monitoring method based on virtual machine introspection is proposed. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively monitor the container files and introduce an acceptable monitoring overload.</p></details> |  |

We know that, for CQAC queries, the problem of testing containment is $\Pi_2 ^p$ -complete. However, there are broad classes of queries with semi-interval arithmetic comparisons in the containing query that render the problem solvable in NP. In all cases examined the contained query is allowed to be any CQAC. Interestingly, we also prove that there are simple cases where the problem remains $\Pi_2 ^p$ -complete. We also investigate the complexity of computing certain answers in the framework of answering CQAC queries with semi-interval comparisons using any CQAC views. We prove that maximally contained rewritings in the language of union of CQACs always compute exactly all certain answers. We find cases where we can compute certain answers in polynomial time using maximally contained rewritings.</p></details> | 71 pages 2 figures |
| **[Dstack: A Zero Trust Framework for Confidential Containers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11555v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Web3 applications require execution platforms that maintain confidentiality and integrity without relying on centralized trust authorities. While Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) offer promising capabilities for confidential computing, current implementations face significant limitations when applied to Web3 contexts, particularly in security reliability, censorship resistance, and vendor independence. This paper presents dstack, a comprehensive framework that transforms raw TEE technology into a true Zero Trust platform. We introduce three key innovations: (1) Portable Confidential Containers that enable seamless workload migration across heterogeneous TEE environments while maintaining security guarantees, (2) Decentralized Code Management that leverages smart contracts for transparent governance of TEE applications, and (3) Verifiable Domain Management that ensures secure and verifiable application identity without centralized authorities. These innovations are implemented through three core components: dstack-OS, dstack-KMS, and dstack-Gateway. Together, they demonstrate how to achieve both the performance advantages of VM-level TEE solutions and the trustless guarantees required by Web3 applications. Our evaluation shows that dstack provides comprehensive security guarantees while maintaining practical usability for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring and Exploiting the Resource Isolation Attack Surface of WebAssembly Containers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11242v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the WebAssembly (or Wasm) technology has been rapidly evolving, with many runtimes actively under development, providing cross-platform secure sandboxes for Wasm modules to run as portable containers. Compared with Docker, which isolates applications at the operating system level, Wasm runtimes provide more security mechanisms, such as linear memory, type checking, and protected call stacks. Although Wasm is designed with security in mind and considered to be a more secure container runtime, various security challenges have arisen, and researchers have focused on the security of Wasm runtimes, such as discovering vulnerabilities or proposing new security mechanisms to achieve robust isolation. However, we have observed that the resource isolation is not well protected by the current Wasm runtimes, and attackers can exhaust the host's resources to interfere with the execution of other container instances by exploiting the WASI/WASIX interfaces. And the attack surface has not been well explored and measured. In this paper, we explore the resource isolation attack surface of Wasm runtimes systematically by proposing several static Wasm runtime analysis approaches. Based on the analysis results, we propose several exploitation strategies to break the resource isolation of Wasm runtimes. The experimental results show that malicious Wasm instances can not only consume large amounts of system resources on their own but also introduce high workloads into other components of the underlying operating system, leading to a substantial performance degradation of the whole system. In addition, the mitigation approaches have also been discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 2 figures.

| **[ORCA: Unveiling Obscure Containers In The Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09322v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software development increasingly depends on open-source libraries and third-party components, which are often encapsulated into containerized environments. While improving the development and deployment of applications, this approach introduces security risks, particularly when outdated or vulnerable components are inadvertently included in production environments. Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is a critical process that helps identify and manage packages and dependencies inside a container. However, unintentional modifications to the container filesystem can lead to incomplete container images, which compromise the reliability of SCA tools. In this paper, we examine the limitations of both cloud-based and open-source SCA tools when faced with such obscure images. An analysis of 600 popular containers revealed that obscure containers exist in well-known registries and trusted images and that many tools fail to analyze such containers. To mitigate these issues, we propose an obscuration-resilient methodology for container analysis and introduce ORCA (Obscuration-Resilient Container Analyzer), its open-source implementation. We reported our findings to all vendors using their appropriate channels. Our results demonstrate that ORCA effectively detects the content of obscure containers and achieves a median 40% improvement in file coverage compared to Docker Scout and Syft.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unikernels vs. Containers: A Runtime-Level Performance Comparison for Resource-Constrained Edge Workloads](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07891v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The choice between containers and unikernels is a critical trade-off for edge applications, balancing the container's ecosystem maturity against unikernel's specialized efficiency. However, until now, how this trade-off behaves under the severe memory constraints of industrial edge environments remains insufficiently investigated, especially across different execution models. This work presents an empirical comparison using Go and Node.js applications, representing ahead-of-time (AOT) and just-in-time (JIT) compilation, respectively. While unikernels consistently deliver faster startup times and outperform containers for Go-based workloads in resource-constrained environments, the evaluation results identify a critical performance crossover for Node.js. Below a certain memory threshold, Docker containers maintain stable performance for both I/O-bound and CPU-bound applications, while the Nanos unikernel's performance degrades sharply. This reveals that Linux's memory management capabilities can outweigh the minimalist efficiency of unikernels under resource scarcity, a critical trade-off that, until now, has not been adequately quantified for JIT runtimes in this context. These findings demonstrate that the optimal deployment paradigm depends on both runtime behavior and available system resources, underscoring the need for workload-aware deployment strategies in edge computing.</p></details> |  |

Verifying the correctness of such upgrades remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a verification-based approach to ensure the correctness of the existing functionality in the upgraded version of a PLC software. The method converts the older and the newer versions of the sequential function chart (SFC) into two Petri net models. We then verify whether one model is contained within another, based on a novel containment checking algorithm grounded in symbolic path equivalence. For this purpose, we have developed a home-grown Petri net-based containment checker. Experimental evaluation on 80 real-world benchmarks from the OSCAT library highlights the scalability and effectiveness of the framework. We have compared our approach with verifAPS, a popular tool used for software upgradation, and observed nearly 4x performance improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages with appendix</p></details> |

Containment is determined through the generalized winding number (GWN), a mathematical construction that is indifferent to the arrangement of surfaces in the shape. Applying contemporary techniques for the 3D GWN to trimmed NURBS surfaces requires some form of geometric discretization, introducing computational inefficiency to the algorithm and even risking containment misclassifications near the surface. In contrast, our proposed method uses a novel reformulation of the relevant surface integral based on Stokes' theorem, which operates on the boundary and trimming curves as provided through rapidly converging adaptive quadrature. Batches of queries are further accelerated by memoizing (i.e.\ caching and reusing) quadrature node positions and tangents as they are evaluated. We demonstrate that our GWN method is robust to complex trimming geometry in a CAD model, and is accurate up to arbitrary precision at arbitrary distances from the surface. The derived containment query is therefore robust to model non-watertightness while respecting all curved features of the input shape.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 Pa...</summary><p>18 Pages, 16 Figures, 1 Table</p></details> |

To enable the secure development, execution, and deployment, of applications on TEE platforms, TEE containers have been introduced as middleware solutions. These containers aim to shield applications from potentially malicious operating systems and orchestration interfaces while maintaining usability and reliability. In this paper, we analyze the isolation strategies employed by existing TEE containers to protect secure applications. To address the challenges in analyzing these interfaces, we designed an automated analyzer to precisely identify and evaluate their isolation boundaries. We observed that some TEE containers fail to achieve their intended goals due to critical design and implementation flaws, such as information leakage, rollback attacks, denial-of-service, and Iago attacks, which pose significant security risks. Drawing from our findings, we share key lessons to guide the development of more secure container solutions and discuss emerging trends in TEE containerization design.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional RL faces challenges when dealing with complex, real-world constraints, especially when action space feasibility is explicit and dependent on the corresponding state or trajectory. In this work, we address stochastic sequential dynamic decision-making problems with state-dependent constraints. As a relevant and real-world case study, we focus on the master stowage planning problem in container shipping, which aims to optimize revenue and operational costs under demand uncertainty and operational constraints. We propose a deep RL framework with an encoder-decoder model and feasibility layers that satisfy convex constraints and maintain unbiased gradient flow, which embed problem instances, current solutions, and demand uncertainty to guide learning. Experiments show that our model efficiently finds adaptive, feasible solutions that generalize across varying distributions and scale to larger instances, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in constrained RL and stochastic programming. By uniting artificial intelligence and operations research, our policy empowers humans to make adaptive, uncertainty-aware decisions for resilient and sustainable planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review</p></details> |

In the United States, shipping ports link the domestic economy to global markets and are vital to sustain supply chain flow and economic stability. Maritime shipping accounts for nearly half of the U.S.'s annual international trade, two thirds of which are represented by container shipping. Previous studies highlighted the capability of automation in enhancing container processing; however, unlike in European and East Asian ports, full automation is limited in U.S. ports due to legal protections for human labor. Consequently, there is a need for alternative methods that deliver automation level efficiencies while maintaining the terms of cooperative agreements. This paper proposes an Intelligent Planning System (IPS) that applies the concept of Pareto Optimization to container yards through a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) based recursive appointment system. The results show an improvement from baseline for both daily terminal throughput volumes and processing times. The generated IPS can be employed to provide recommendations for container positioning and truck pickup appointments to optimize container yard layout and flow resulting in reduced realtime congestion and predictively mitigated future congestion.</p></details> | 19 pages |

The software is distributed both as native packages and specialized production containers. Following an approach used in other communities like web development, we built our workspaces, system-like containers to ease development and testing. Developers can change the source tree or check out a different branch and quickly reconfigure the services to see the effect of their changes. In this paper, we will talk about what differentiates workspaces from other containers. We will describe our base system, composed of three containers: a one-node cluster including a compute element and a batch system, a GlideinWMS Factory controlling pilot jobs, and a scheduler and Frontend to submit jobs and provision resources. Additional containers can be used for optional components. This system can easily run on a laptop, and we will share our evaluation of different container runtimes, with an eye for ease of use and performance. Finally, we will talk about our experience as developers and with students. The GlideinWMS workspaces are easily integrated with IDEs like VS Code, simplifying debugging and allowing development and testing of the system even when offline.

However, vision systems based on conventional imaging are limited to extracting information only from the visible surfaces of scene objects. For instance, a vision system can detect and identify a Coke can in the scene, but it cannot determine whether the can is full or empty. In this paper, we aim to expand the scope of computer vision to include the novel task of inferring the hidden liquid levels of opaque containers by sensing the tiny vibrations on their surfaces. Our method provides a first-of-a-kind way to inspect the fill level of multiple sealed containers remotely, at once, without needing physical manipulation and manual weighing. First, we propose a novel speckle-based vibration sensing system for simultaneously capturing scene vibrations on a 2D grid of points. We use our system to efficiently and remotely capture a dataset of vibration responses for a variety of everyday liquid containers. Then, we develop a transformer-based approach for analyzing the captured vibrations and classifying the container type and its hidden liquid level at the time of measurement. Our architecture is invariant to the vibration source, yielding correct liquid level estimates for controlled and ambient scene sound sources. Moreover, our model generalizes to unseen container instances within known classes (e.g., training on five Coke cans of a six-pack, testing on a sixth) and fluid levels. We demonstrate our method by recovering liquid levels from various everyday containers.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[Sampling-Based Estimation of Jaccard Containment and Similarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10019v3)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of estimating the containment and similarity between two sets using only random samples from each set, without relying on sketches of full sets. The study introduces a binomial model for predicting the overlap between samples, demonstrating that it is both accurate and practical when sample sizes are small compared to the original sets. The paper compares this model to previous approaches and shows that it provides better estimates under the considered conditions. It also analyzes the statistical properties of the estimator, including error bounds and sample size requirements needed to achieve a desired level of accuracy and confidence. The framework is extended to estimate set similarity, and the paper provides guidance for applying these methods in large scale data systems where only partial or sampled data is available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finite element modeling of V-notched thermoelastic strain-limiting solids containing inclusions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09300v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A precise domain triangulation is recognized as indispensable for the accurate numerical approximation of differential operators within collocation methods, leading to a substantial reduction in discretization errors. An efficient finite element method (FEM) is presented in this paper, meticulously developed to solve a complex mathematical model. This model governs the behavior of thermoelastic solids containing both a V-notch and inclusions. The system of partial differential equations underlying this model consists of two primary components: a linear elliptic equation, which is used to describe the temperature distribution, and a quasilinear equation, which governs the mechanical behavior of the body. Through the application of this specifically tailored FEM, accurate and efficient solutions are able to be obtained for these intricate thermoelastic problems. The algebraically nonlinear constitutive equation, alongside the balance of linear momentum, is effectively reduced to a second-order quasi-linear elliptic partial differential equation. Complex curved boundaries are represented through the application of a smooth, distinctive point transformation. Furthermore, higher-order shape functions are employed to ensure the accurate computation of entries within the FEM matrices and vectors, from which a highly precise approximate solution to the BVP is subsequently obtained. The inherent nonlinearities in the governing differential equation are addressed through the implementation of a Picard-type linearization scheme. Numerical results, derived from a series of test cases, have consistently demonstrated a significant enhancement in accuracy, a crucial achievement for the nuanced analysis of thermoelastic solids.</p></details> |  |
| **[Formalising Inductive and Coinductive Containers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02603v5)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Containers capture the concept of strictly positive data types in programming. The original development of containers is done in the internal language of locally cartesian closed categories (LCCCs) with disjoint coproducts and W-types, and uniqueness of identity proofs (UIP) is implicitly assumed throughout. Although it is claimed that these developments can also be interpreted in extensional Martin-L\"of type theory, this interpretation is not made explicit. In this paper, we present a formalisation of the results that 'containers preserve least and greatest fixed points' in Cubical Agda, thereby giving a formulation in intensional type theory. Our proofs do not make use of UIP and thereby generalise the original results from talking about container functors on Set to container functors on the wild category of types. Our main incentive for using Cubical Agda is that its path type restores the equivalence between bisimulation and coinductive equality. Thus, besides developing container theory in a more general setting, we also demonstrate the usefulness of Cubical Agda's path type to coinductive proofs.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages main text.

Not-contains is practically relevant, for instance in symbolic execution of string manipulating programs. Particularly, we show that the predicate $\neg\mathit{Contains}(x_1 \ldots x_n, y_1 \ldots y_m)$, where $x_1 \ldots x_n$ and $y_1 \ldots y_m$ are sequences of string variables constrained by regular languages, is decidable. Decidability of a not-contains predicate combined with chain-free word equations and regular membership constraints follows.</p></details> |  |

A typical service life for a container is more than 20 years. However, overtime containers suffer various types of damage due to the mechanical as well as natural factors. A damaged container is a safety hazard for the employees handling it and a liability for the logistic company. Therefore, a timely inspection and detection of the damaged container is a key for prolonging service life as well as avoiding safety hazards. In this paper, we will compare the performance of the damage detection by three state-of-the-art advanced computer vision models Yolov12, Yolov11 and RF-DETR. We will use a dataset of 278 annotated images to train, validate and test the model. We will compare the mAP and precision of the model. The objective of this paper is to identify the model that is best suited for container damage detection. The result is mixed. mAP@50 score of Yolov11 and 12 was 81.9% compared to RF-DETR, which was 77.7%. However, while testing the model for not-so-common damaged containers, the RF-DETR model outperformed the others overall, exhibiting superiority to accurately detecting both damaged containers as well as damage occurrences with high confidence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributive Laws of Monadic Containers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17191v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Containers are used to carve out a class of strictly positive data types in terms of shapes and positions. They can be interpreted via a fully-faithful functor into endofunctors on Set. Monadic containers are those containers whose interpretation as a Set functor carries a monad structure. The category of containers is closed under container composition and is a monoidal category, whereas monadic containers do not in general compose. In this paper, we develop a characterisation of distributive laws of monadic containers. Distributive laws were introduced as a sufficient condition for the composition of the underlying functors of two monads to also carry a monad structure. Our development parallels Ahman and Uustalu's characterisation of distributive laws of directed containers, i.e. containers whose Set functor interpretation carries a comonad structure. Furthermore, by combining our work with theirs, we construct characterisations of mixed distributive laws (i.e. of directed containers over monadic containers and vice versa), thereby completing the 'zoo' of container characterisations of (co)monads and their distributive laws. We have found these characterisations amenable to development of existence and uniqueness proofs of distributive laws, particularly in the mechanised setting of Cubical Agda, in which most of the theory of this paper has been formalised.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages main text, 4 pages appendices.

Existing CASS datasets only contain reading-style sounds as a speech stem. These datasets differ from actual movie audio, which is more likely to include acted-out voices. Consequently, models trained on conventional datasets tend to have issues where emotionally heightened voices, such as laughter and screams, are more easily separated as an effect, not speech. To address this problem, we build a new dataset, DnR-nonverbal. The proposed dataset includes non-verbal sounds like laughter and screams in the speech stem. From the experiments, we reveal the issue of non-verbal sound extraction by the current CASS model and show that our dataset can effectively address the issue in the synthetic and actual movie audio.

| **[LRScheduler: A Layer-aware and Resource-adaptive Container Scheduler in Edge Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03694v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lightweight containers provide an efficient approach for deploying computation-intensive applications in network edge. The layered storage structure of container images can further reduce the deployment cost and container startup time. Existing researches discuss layer sharing scheduling theoretically but with little attention paid to the practical implementation. To fill in this gap, we propose and implement a Layer-aware and Resource-adaptive container Scheduler (LRScheduler) in edge computing. Specifically, we first utilize container image layer information to design and implement a node scoring and container scheduling mechanism. This mechanism can effectively reduce the download cost when deploying containers, which is very important in edge computing with limited bandwidth. Then, we design a dynamically weighted and resource-adaptive mechanism to enhance load balancing in edge clusters, increasing layer sharing scores when resource load is low to use idle resources effectively. Our scheduler is built on the scheduling framework of Kubernetes, enabling full process automation from task information acquisition to container dep=loyment. Testing on a real system has shown that our design can effectively reduce the container deployment cost as compared with the default scheduler.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 10 figures, The 20th International Conference on Mobility, Sensing and Networking (MSN 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Bag Semantics Query Containment: The CQ vs. UCQ Case and Other Stories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07219v3)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Query Containment Problem (QCP) is a fundamental decision problem in query processing and optimization. While QCP has for a long time been completely understood for the case of set semantics, decidability of QCP for conjunctive queries under multi-set semantics ($QCP_{\text{CQ}}^{\text{bag}}$) remains one of the most intriguing open problems in database theory. Certain effort has been put, in last 30 years, to solve this problem and some decidable special cases of $QCP_{\text{CQ}}^{\text{bag}}$ were identified, as well as some undecidable extensions, including $QCP_{\text{UCQ}}^{\text{bag}}$. In this paper we introduce a new technique which produces, for a given UCQ $\Phi$, a CQ $\phi$ such that the application of $\phi$ to a database $D$ is, in some sense, an approximation of the application of $\Phi$ to $D$. Using this technique we could analyze the status of $QCP^{\text{bag}}$ when one of the queries in question is a CQ and the other is a UCQ, and we reached conclusions which surprised us a little bit. We also tried to use this technique to translate the known undecidability proof for $QCP_{\text{UCQ}}^{\text{bag}}$ into a proof of undecidability of $QCP_{\text{CQ}}^{\text{bag}}$. And, as you are going to see, we got stopped just one infinitely small $\varepsilon$ before reaching this ultimate goal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Expan...</summary><p>Expanded explanations to provide better intuitions</p></details> |

However, the rapid adoption of container technologies introduces significant security challenges that require careful management. This paper investigates key areas of container security, including runtime protection, network safeguards, configuration best practices, supply chain security, and comprehensive monitoring and logging solutions. We identify common vulnerabilities within these domains and provide actionable recommendations to address and mitigate these risks. By integrating security throughout the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), organizations can reinforce their security posture, creating a resilient and reliable containerized application infrastructure that withstands evolving threats.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient isogeometric Boundary Element simulation of elastic domains containing thin inclusions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19170v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper is concerned with the Boundary Element simulation of elastic domains that contain thin inclusions that have elastic material properties, which are different to the domain. With thin inclusions we mean inclusions with extreme aspect ratios, i.e. where one dimension is much smaller than the other ones. Examples of this are reinforcements in civil/mechanical engineering or concrete linings in underground construction. The fact that an inclusion has an extreme aspect ratio poses a challenge to the numerical integration of the arising singular integrals and novel approaches are presented to deal with it. Several examples demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed methods and show that the results are in good agreement with analytical and other numerical solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 22 figures, 1 appendix</p></details> |
| **[Containment for Guarded Monotone Strict NP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01254v4)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Guarded Monotone Strict NP (GMSNP) extends Monotone Monadic Strict NP (MMSNP) by guarded existentially quantified predicates of arbitrary arities. We prove that the containment problem for GMSNP is decidable, thereby settling an open question of Bienvenu, ten Cate, Lutz, and Wolter, later restated by Bourhis and Lutz. Our proof also comes with a 2NEXPTIME upper bound on the complexity of the problem, which matches the lower bound for containment of MMSNP due to Bourhis and Lutz. In order to obtain these results, we significantly improve the state of knowledge of the model-theoretic properties of GMSNP. Bodirsky, Kn\"{a}uer, and Starke previously showed that every GMSNP sentence defines a finite union of CSPs of $\omega$-categorical structures. We show that these structures can be used to obtain a reduction from the containment problem for GMSNP to the much simpler problem of testing the existence of a certain map called recolouring, albeit in a more general setting than GMSNP; a careful analysis of this yields said upper bound. As a secondary contribution, we refine the construction of Bodirsky, Kn\"{a}uer, and Starke by adding a restricted form of homogeneity to the properties of these structures, making the logic amenable to future complexity classifications for query evaluation using techniques developed for infinite-domain CSPs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extending the Control Plane of Container Orchestrators for I/O Virtualization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06041v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single Root Input/Output Virtualization (SR-IOV) is a standard technology for forking a single PCI express device and providing it to applications while ensuring performance isolation. It enables container orchestrators to share a limited number of physical network interfaces without incurring significant virtualization overhead. The allocation of virtualized network devices to containers, however, needs to be more configurable based on the bandwidth needs of running applications. Moreover, container orchestrators' network control over the virtualized interfaces is limited by the abilities of SR-IOV. We explore the design considerations for a system with controlled SR-IOV virtualization and present ConRDMA, a novel architecture that enables fine control of RDMA virtualization for containers. Our evaluation shows that ConRDMA enables containers to use RDMA allocated bandwidth more efficiently and to select best-suited nodes to meet their varying communication requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Performance Characterization of Containers in Edge Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02082v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Edge computing addresses critical limitations of cloud computing such as high latency and network congestion by decentralizing processing from cloud to the edge. However, the need for software replication across heterogeneous edge devices introduces dependency and portability challenges, driving the adoption of containerization technologies like Docker. While containers offer lightweight isolation and deployment advantages, they introduce new bottlenecks in edge environments, including cold-start delays, memory constraints, network throughput variability, and inefficient IO handling when interfacing with embedded peripherals. This paper presents an empirical evaluation of Docker containers on resource-constrained edge devices, using Raspberry Pi as a representative platform. We benchmark performance across diverse workloads, including microbenchmarks (CPU, memory, network profiling) and macrobenchmarks (AI inference, sensor IO operations), to quantify the overheads of containerization in real-world edge scenarios. Our testbed comprises physical Raspberry Pi nodes integrated with environmental sensors and camera modules, enabling measurements of latency, memory faults, IO throughput, and cold start delays under varying loads. Key findings reveal trade-offs between container isolation and edge-specific resource limitations, with performance degradation observed in IO heavy and latency sensitive tasks. We identify configuration optimizations to mitigate these issues, providing actionable insights for deploying containers in edge environments while meeting real time and reliability requirements. This work advances the understanding of containerized edge computing by systematically evaluating its feasibility and pitfalls on low-power embedded systems.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces the SCU-Hand (Soft Conical Universal Robot Hand), a novel end-effector designed to automate the task of scooping powdered samples from various container sizes using a robotic arm. The SCU-Hand employs a flexible, conical structure that adapts to different container geometries through deformation, maintaining consistent contact without complex force sensing or machine learning-based control methods. Its reconfigurable mechanism allows for size adjustment, enabling efficient scooping from diverse container types. By combining soft robotics principles with a sheet-morphing design, our end-effector achieves high flexibility while retaining the necessary stiffness for effective powder manipulation. We detail the design principles, fabrication process, and experimental validation of the SCU-Hand. Experimental validation showed that the scooping capacity is about 20% higher than that of a commercial tool, with a scooping performance of more than 95% for containers of sizes between 67 mm to 110 mm. This research contributes to laboratory automation by offering a cost-effective, easily implementable solution for automating tasks such as materials synthesis and characterization processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA2025).

However, inter-process communication (IPC) between co-located microservices often suffers from significant overhead, especially when traditional networking protocols are employed within containers. This paper introduces a novel approach, MPKLink, leveraging Intel Memory Protection Keys (MPK) to enhance intra-container communication efficiency while ensuring security. By utilizing shared memory with MPK-based access control, we eliminate unnecessary networking latencies, leading to reduced resource consumption and faster response times. We present a comprehensive evaluation of MPKLink, demonstrating its superior performance over conventional methods such as REST and gRPC within microservice architectures. Furthermore, we explore the integration of this approach with existing container orchestration platforms, showcasing its seamless adoption in real-world deployment scenarios. This work provides a transformative solution for developers looking to optimize communication in microservices while maintaining the integrity and security of containerized applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Drayage, the short-haul trucking of containers, plays a critical role in intermodal container logistics. Using dynamic programming, we identify optimal operational policies for allocating drayage volumes among capacitated carriers under uncertain container flows and spot rates. The computational complexity of optimization under uncertainty is mitigated through sample average approximation. These optimal policies serve as the basis for evaluating specific capacity arrangements. To optimize capacity reservations with strategic and spot carriers, we employ an efficient quasi-Newton method. Numerical experiments demonstrate significant cost-efficiency improvements, including a 21.2% cost reduction in a four-period scenario. Monte Carlo simulations further highlight the strong generalization capabilities of the proposed joint optimization method across out-of-sample scenarios. These findings underscore the importance of integrating strategic and operational decisions to enhance cost efficiency in truckload procurement under uncertainty.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Dimensioning of Frequency Containment Reserves: The Case of the Nordic Grid](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11093v2)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the main responsibilities of a Transmission System Operator (TSO) operating an electric grid is to maintain a designated frequency (e.g., 50 Hz in Europe). To achieve this, TSOs have created several products called frequency-supporting ancillary services. The Frequency Containment Reserve (FCR) is one of these ancillary service products. This article focuses on the TSO problem of determining the volume procured for FCR. Specifically, we investigate the potential benefits and impact on grid security when transitioning from a traditionally \textit{static} procurement method to a \textit{dynamic} strategy for FCR volume. We take the Nordic synchronous area in Europe as a case study and use a diffusion model to capture its frequency development. We introduce a controlled mean reversal parameter to assess changes in FCR obligations, in particular for the Nordic FCR-N ancillary service product. We establish closed-form expressions for exceedance probabilities and use historical frequency data as input to calibrate the model. We show that a dynamic dimensioning approach for FCR has the potential to significantly reduce the exceedance probabilities (up to $37\%$) while maintaining the total yearly procured FCR volume equal to that of the current static approach. Alternatively, a dynamic dimensioning approach could significantly increase security at limited extra cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 12 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Power Systems</p></details> |

Existing CRP studies primarily focus on minimizing reallocation costs using two-dimensional bay structures, considering factors such as container size, weight, arrival sequences, and retrieval priorities. This paper introduces an enhanced deepening search algorithm integrated with improved lower bounds to boost search efficiency. To further reduce the search space, we design mutually consistent pruning rules to avoid excessive computational overhead. The proposed algorithm is validated on three widely used benchmark datasets for the Unrestricted Container Rehandling Problem (UCRP). Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art exact algorithms in solving the more general UCRP variant, particularly exhibiting superior efficiency when handling containers within the same priority group under strict time constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Verif...</summary><p>Verification confirmed that this article used data without authorization from the original owners, violating ethical standards for scientific data sharing.
