| **[Abstraction of Trusted Execution Environments as the Missing Layer for Broad Confidential Computing Adoption: A Systematization of Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22090v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) protect sensitive code and data from the operating system, hypervisor, or other untrusted software. Different solutions exist, each proposing different features. Abstraction layers aim to unify the ecosystem, allowing application developers and system administrators to leverage confidential computing as broadly and efficiently as possible. We start with an overview of representative available TEE technologies. We describe and summarize each TEE ecosystem, classifying them in different categories depending on their main design choices. Then, we propose a systematization of knowledge focusing on different abstraction layers around each design choice. We describe the underlying technologies of each design, as well as the inner workings and features of each abstraction layer. Our study reveals opportunities for improving existing abstraction layer solutions. It also highlights WebAssembly, a promising approach that supports the largest set of features. We close with a discussion on future directions for research, such as how future abstraction layers may evolve and integrate with the confidential computing ecosystem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimistic TEE-Rollups: A Hybrid Architecture for Scalable and Verifiable Generative AI Inference on Blockchain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20176v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) is currently bottlenecked by the Verifiability Trilemma, which posits that a decentralized inference system cannot simultaneously achieve high computational integrity, low latency, and low cost. Existing cryptographic solutions, such as Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (ZKML), suffer from superlinear proving overheads (O(k NlogN)) that render them infeasible for billionparameter models. Conversely, optimistic approaches (opML) impose prohibitive dispute windows, preventing real-time interactivity, while recent "Proof of Quality" (PoQ) paradigms sacrifice cryptographic integrity for subjective semantic evaluation, leaving networks vulnerable to model downgrade attacks and reward hacking. In this paper, we introduce Optimistic TEE-Rollups (OTR), a hybrid verification protocol that harmonizes these constraints. OTR leverages NVIDIA H100 Confidential Computing Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to provide sub-second Provisional Finality, underpinned by an optimistic fraud-proof mechanism and stochastic Zero-Knowledge spot-checks to mitigate hardware side-channel risks. We formally define Proof of Efficient Attribution (PoEA), a consensus mechanism that cryptographically binds execution traces to hardware attestations, thereby guaranteeing model authenticity. Extensive simulations demonstrate that OTR achieves 99% of the throughput of centralized baselines with a marginal cost overhead of $0.07 per query, maintaining Byzantine fault tolerance against rational adversaries even in the presence of transient hardware vulnerabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Confidential, Attestable, and Efficient Inter-CVM Communication with Arm CCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01594v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs) are increasingly adopted to protect sensitive workloads from privileged adversaries such as the hypervisor. While they provide strong isolation guarantees, existing CVM architectures lack first-class mechanisms for inter-CVM data sharing due to their disjoint memory model, making inter-CVM data exchange a performance bottleneck in compartmentalized or collaborative multi-CVM systems. Under this model, a CVM's accessible memory is either shared with the hypervisor or protected from both the hypervisor and all other CVMs. This design simplifies reasoning about memory ownership; however, it fundamentally precludes plaintext data sharing between CVMs because all inter-CVM communication must pass through hypervisor-accessible memory, requiring costly encryption and decryption to preserve confidentiality and integrity. In this paper, we introduce CAEC, a system that enables protected memory sharing between CVMs. CAEC builds on Arm Confidential Compute Architecture (CCA) and extends its firmware to support Confidential Shared Memory (CSM), a memory region securely shared between multiple CVMs while remaining inaccessible to the hypervisor and all non-participating CVMs. CAEC's design is fully compatible with CCA hardware and introduces only a modest increase (4%) in CCA firmware code size. CAEC delivers substantial performance benefits across a range of workloads. For instance, inter-CVM communication over CAEC achieves up to 209$\times$ reduction in CPU cycles compared to encryption-based mechanisms over hypervisor-accessible shared memory. By combining high performance, strong isolation guarantees, and attestable sharing semantics, CAEC provides a practical and scalable foundation for the next generation of trusted multi-CVM services across both edge and cloud environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Confidential Prompting: Privacy-preserving LLM Inference on Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19134v5)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a vision of confidential prompting: securing user prompts from an untrusted, cloud-hosted large language model (LLM) while preserving model confidentiality, output invariance, and compute efficiency. As a first step toward this vision, we present Petridish, a system built on top of confidential computing and its core contribution, a novel technology called Secure Partitioned Decoding (SPD). Petridish runs the LLM service inside a confidential virtual machine (CVM), which protects the secrets, i.e., the LLM parameters and user prompts, from adversaries outside the CVM. Importantly, it splits the LLM service for a user into two processes, using SPD: a per-user process performs prefill with the user prompts and computes attention scores during decoding; a service process, shared by all users, batches the attention scores from per-user processes and generates output tokens for all users. Both the LLM provider and the users trust Petridish's CVM and its operating system, which guarantees isolation between processes and limits their outbound network capabilities to control information flow. The CVM's attestation capability and its open-source software stack enable Petridish to provide auditable protection of both user prompt and LLM confidentiality. Together, Petridish maintains full utility of LLM service and enables practical, privacy-preserving cloud-hosted LLM inference for sensitive applications, such as processing personal data, clinical records, and financial documents.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Workflow for Full Traceability of AI Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11275v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An ever increasing number of high-stake decisions are made or assisted by automated systems employing brittle artificial intelligence technology. There is a substantial risk that some of these decision induce harm to people, by infringing their well-being or their fundamental human rights. The state-of-the-art in AI systems makes little effort with respect to appropriate documentation of the decision process. This obstructs the ability to trace what went into a decision, which in turn is a prerequisite to any attempt of reconstructing a responsibility chain. Specifically, such traceability is linked to a documentation that will stand up in court when determining the cause of some AI-based decision that inadvertently or intentionally violates the law. This paper takes a radical, yet practical, approach to this problem, by enforcing the documentation of each and every component that goes into the training or inference of an automated decision. As such, it presents the first running workflow supporting the generation of tamper-proof, verifiable and exhaustive traces of AI decisions. In doing so, we expand the DBOM concept into an effective running workflow leveraging confidential computing technology. We demonstrate the inner workings of the workflow in the development of an app to tell poisonous and edible mushrooms apart, meant as a playful example of high-stake decision support.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Securing Generative AI in Healthcare: A Zero-Trust Architecture Powered by Confidential Computing on Google Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11836v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in healthcare is impeded by significant security challenges unaddressed by traditional frameworks, precisely the data-in-use gap where sensitive patient data and proprietary AI models are exposed during active processing. To address this, the paper proposes the Confidential Zero-Trust Framework (CZF), a novel security paradigm that synergistically combines Zero-Trust Architecture for granular access control with the hardware-enforced data isolation of Confidential Computing. We detailed a multi-tiered architectural blueprint for implementing the CZF on Google Cloud and analyzed its efficacy against real-world threats. The CZF provides a defense-in-depth architecture where data remains encrypted while in-use within a hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). The framework's use of remote attestation offers cryptographic proof of workload integrity, transforming compliance from a procedural exercise into a verifiable technical fact and enabling secure, multi-party collaborations previously blocked by security and intellectual property concerns. By closing the data-in-use gap and enforcing Zero-Trust principles, the CZF provides a robust and verifiable framework that establishes the necessary foundation of trust to enable the responsible adoption of transformative AI technologies in healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 Pa...</summary><p>19 Pages, 1 Figure, 1 Table</p></details> |
| **[Experiences Building Enterprise-Level Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning to Power AI for Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08998v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach to enabling collaborative model training without centralized data sharing, a crucial requirement in scientific domains where data privacy, ownership, and compliance constraints are critical. However, building user-friendly enterprise-level FL frameworks that are both scalable and privacy-preserving remains challenging, especially when bridging the gap between local prototyping and distributed deployment across heterogeneous client computing infrastructures. In this paper, based on our experiences building the Advanced Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (APPFL) framework, we present our vision for an enterprise-grade, privacy-preserving FL framework designed to scale seamlessly across computing environments. We identify several key capabilities that such a framework must provide: (1) Scalable local simulation and prototyping to accelerate experimentation and algorithm design; (2) seamless transition from simulation to deployment; (3) distributed deployment across diverse, real-world infrastructures, from personal devices to cloud clusters and HPC systems; (4) multi-level abstractions that balance ease of use and research flexibility; and (5) comprehensive privacy and security through techniques such as differential privacy, secure aggregation, robust authentication, and confidential computing. We further discuss architectural designs to realize these goals. This framework aims to bridge the gap between research prototypes and enterprise-scale deployment, enabling scalable, reliable, and privacy-preserving AI for science.</p></details> |  |
| **[Confidential Computing for Cloud Security: Exploring Hardware based Encryption Using Trusted Execution Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04550v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growth of cloud computing has revolutionized data processing and storage capacities to another levels of scalability and flexibility. But in the process, it has created a huge challenge of security, especially in terms of safeguarding sensitive data. Classical security practices, including encryption at rest and during transit, fail to protect data in use and expose it to various possible breaches. In response to this problem , Confidential Computing has been a tool ,seeking to secure data in processing by usage of hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). TEEs, including Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX) and ARM's TrustZone, offers protected contexts within the processor, where data is kept confidential ,intact and secure , even with malicious software or compromised operating systems. In this research, we have explored the architecture and security features of TEEs like Intel SGX and ARM TrustZone, and their effectiveness in improving cloud data security. From a thorough literature survey ,we have analyzed the deployment strategies, performance indicators, and practical uses of these TEEs for the same purpose. In addition, we have discussed the issues regarding deployment, possible weaknesses, scalability issues, and integration issues. Our results focuses on the central position of TEEs in strengthening and advancing cloud security infrastructures, pointing towards their ability to create a secure foundation for Confidential Computing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Chain Sealed-Bid Auctions Using Confidential Compute Blockchains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19491v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sealed-bid auctions ensure fair competition and efficient allocation but are often deployed on centralized infrastructure, enabling opaque manipulation. Public blockchains eliminate central control, yet their inherent transparency conflicts with the confidentiality required for sealed bidding. Prior attempts struggle to reconcile privacy, verifiability, and scalability without relying on trusted intermediaries, multi-round protocols, or expensive cryptography. We present a sealed-bid auction protocol that executes sensitive bidding logic on a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)-backed confidential compute blockchain while retaining settlement and enforcement on a public chain. Bidders commit funds to enclave-generated escrow addresses, ensuring confidentiality and binding commitments. After the deadline, any party can trigger resolution: the confidential blockchain determines the winner through verifiable off-chain computation and issues signed settlement transactions for execution on the public chain. Our design provides security, privacy, and scalability without trusted third parties or protocol modifications. We implement it on SUAVE with Ethereum settlement, evaluate its scalability and trust assumptions, and demonstrate deployment with minimal integration on existing infrastructure</p></details> |  |
| **[sNVMe-oF: Secure and Efficient Disaggregated Storage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18756v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disaggregated storage with NVMe-over-Fabrics (NVMe-oF) has emerged as the standard solution in modern data centers, achieving superior performance, resource utilization, and power efficiency. Simultaneously, confidential computing (CC) is becoming the de facto security paradigm, enforcing stronger isolation and protection for sensitive workloads. However, securing state-of-the-art storage with traditional CC methods struggles to scale and compromises performance or security. To address these issues, we introduce sNVMe-oF, a storage management system extending the NVMe-oF protocol and adhering to the CC threat model by providing confidentiality, integrity, and freshness guarantees. sNVMe-oF offers an appropriate control path and novel concepts such as counter-leasing. sNVMe-oF also optimizes data path performance by leveraging NVMe metadata, introducing a new disaggregated Hazel Merkle Tree (HMT), and avoiding redundant IPSec protections. We achieve this without modifying the NVMe-oF protocol. To prevent excessive resource usage while delivering line rate, sNVMe-oF also uses accelerators of CC-capable smart NICs. We prototype sNVMe-oF on an NVIDIA BlueField-3 and demonstrate how it can achieve as little as 2% performance degradation for synthetic patterns and AI training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agora: Trust Less and Open More in Verification for Confidential Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15062v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary verification plays a pivotal role in software security, yet building a verification service that is both open and trustworthy poses a formidable challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel binary verification service, AGORA, scrupulously designed to overcome the challenge. At the heart of this approach lies a strategic insight: certain tasks can be delegated to untrusted entities, while the corresponding validators are securely housed within the trusted computing base (TCB). AGORA can validate untrusted assertions generated for versatile policies. Through a novel blockchain-based bounty task manager, it also utilizes crowdsourcing to remove trust in theorem provers. These synergistic techniques successfully ameliorate the TCB size burden associated with two procedures: binary analysis and theorem proving. The design of AGORA allows untrusted parties to participate in these complex processes. Moreover, based on running the optimized TCB within trusted execution environments and recording the verification process on a blockchain, the public can audit the correctness of verification results. By implementing verification workflows for software-based fault isolation policy and side-channel mitigation, our evaluation demonstrates the efficacy of AGORA.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in OOPSLA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Confidential LLM Inference: Performance and Cost Across CPU and GPU TEEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18886v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed on converged Cloud and High-Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructure. However, as LLMs handle confidential inputs and are fine-tuned on costly, proprietary datasets, their heightened security requirements slow adoption in privacy-sensitive sectors such as healthcare and finance. We investigate methods to address this gap and propose Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) as a solution for securing end-to-end LLM inference. We validate their practicality by evaluating these compute-intensive workloads entirely within CPU and GPU TEEs. On the CPU side, we conduct an in-depth study running full Llama2 inference pipelines (7B, 13B, 70B) inside Intel's TDX and SGX, accelerated by Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX). We derive 12 insights, including that across various data types, batch sizes, and input lengths, CPU TEEs impose under 10% throughput and 20% latency overheads, further reduced by AMX. We run LLM inference on NVIDIA H100 Confidential Compute GPUs, contextualizing our CPU findings and observing throughput penalties of 4-8% that diminish as batch and input sizes grow. By comparing performance, cost, and security trade-offs, we show how CPU TEEs can be more cost-effective or secure than their GPU counterparts. To our knowledge, our work is the first to comprehensively demonstrate the performance and practicality of modern TEEs across both CPUs and GPUs for enabling confidential LLMs (cLLMs).</p></details> |  |
| **[Dstack: A Zero Trust Framework for Confidential Containers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11555v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Web3 applications require execution platforms that maintain confidentiality and integrity without relying on centralized trust authorities. While Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) offer promising capabilities for confidential computing, current implementations face significant limitations when applied to Web3 contexts, particularly in security reliability, censorship resistance, and vendor independence. This paper presents dstack, a comprehensive framework that transforms raw TEE technology into a true Zero Trust platform. We introduce three key innovations: (1) Portable Confidential Containers that enable seamless workload migration across heterogeneous TEE environments while maintaining security guarantees, (2) Decentralized Code Management that leverages smart contracts for transparent governance of TEE applications, and (3) Verifiable Domain Management that ensures secure and verifiable application identity without centralized authorities. These innovations are implemented through three core components: dstack-OS, dstack-KMS, and dstack-Gateway. Together, they demonstrate how to achieve both the performance advantages of VM-level TEE solutions and the trustless guarantees required by Web3 applications. Our evaluation shows that dstack provides comprehensive security guarantees while maintaining practical usability for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Characterizing Trust Boundary Vulnerabilities in TEE Containers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20962v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) have emerged as a cornerstone of confidential computing, garnering significant attention from both academia and industry. To enable the secure development, execution, and deployment, of applications on TEE platforms, TEE containers have been introduced as middleware solutions. These containers aim to shield applications from potentially malicious operating systems and orchestration interfaces while maintaining usability and reliability. In this paper, we analyze the isolation strategies employed by existing TEE containers to protect secure applications. To address the challenges in analyzing these interfaces, we designed an automated analyzer to precisely identify and evaluate their isolation boundaries. We observed that some TEE containers fail to achieve their intended goals due to critical design and implementation flaws, such as information leakage, rollback attacks, denial-of-service, and Iago attacks, which pose significant security risks. Drawing from our findings, we share key lessons to guide the development of more secure container solutions and discuss emerging trends in TEE containerization design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Characterization of GPU TEE Overheads in Distributed Data Parallel ML Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11771v3)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential computing (CC) or trusted execution enclaves (TEEs) is now the most common approach to enable secure computing in the cloud. The recent introduction of GPU TEEs by NVIDIA enables machine learning (ML) models to be trained without leaking model weights or data to the cloud provider. However, the potential performance implications of using GPU TEEs for ML training are not well characterized. In this work, we present an in-depth characterization study on performance overhead associated with running distributed data parallel (DDP) ML training with GPU Trusted Execution Environments (TEE). Our study reveals the performance challenges in DDP training within GPU TEEs. DDP uses ring-all-reduce, a well-known approach, to aggregate gradients from multiple devices. Ring all-reduce consists of multiple scatter-reduce and all-gather operations. In GPU TEEs only the GPU package (GPU and HBM memory) is trusted. Hence, any data communicated outside the GPU packages must be encrypted and authenticated for confidentiality and integrity verification. Hence, each phase of the ring-all-reduce requires encryption and message authentication code (MAC) generation from the sender, and decryption and MAC authentication on the receiver. As the number of GPUs participating in DDP increases, the overhead of secure inter-GPU communication during ring-all-reduce grows proportionally. Additionally, larger models lead to more asynchronous all-reduce operations, exacerbating the communication cost. Our results show that with four GPU TEEs, depending on the model that is being trained, the runtime per training iteration increases by an average of 8x and up to a maximum of 41.6x compared to DDP training without TEE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Confidential Serverless Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21518v3)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although serverless computing offers compelling cost and deployment simplicity advantages, a significant challenge remains in securely managing sensitive data as it flows through the network of ephemeral function executions in serverless computing environments within untrusted clouds. While Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs) offer a promising secure execution environment, their integration with serverless architectures currently faces fundamental limitations in key areas: security, performance, and resource efficiency. We present WALLET, a confidential computing system for secure serverless deployments to overcome these limitations. By employing nested confidential execution and a decoupled guest OS within CVMs, WALLET runs each function in a minimal "trustlet", significantly improving security through a reduced Trusted Computing Base (TCB). Furthermore, by leveraging a data-centric I/O architecture built upon a lightweight LibOS, WALLET optimizes network communication to address performance and resource efficiency challenges. Our evaluation shows that compared to CVM-based deployments, WALLET has 4.3x smaller TCB, improves end-to-end latency (15-93%), achieves higher function density (up to 907x), and reduces inter-function communication (up to 27x) and function chaining latency (16.7-30.2x); thus, WALLET offers a practical system for confidential serverless computing.</p></details> |  |
| **[HSM and TPM Failures in Cloud: A Real-World Taxonomy and Emerging Defenses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17655v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As cloud infrastructure becomes the backbone of modern organizations, the security of cryptographic key management, especially using Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) and Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs), faces unprecedented challenges. While these hardware-based solutions offer strong protection in isolated environments, their effectiveness is being undermined by cloud-native threats such as misconfigurations, compromised APIs, and lateral privilege escalations. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of publicly disclosed attacks and breaches involving HSMs and TPMs in cloud environments, identifying recurring architectural and operational flaws. We propose a taxonomy of attack vectors based on real-world case studies and threat intelligence reports, highlighting the gaps between hardware trust anchors and dynamic cloud ecosystems. Furthermore, we evaluate emerging defensive paradigms: confidential computing, post-quantum cryptography, and decentralized key management systems (dKMS), assessing their potential to address these gaps. Our findings emphasize that securing cloud-based cryptographic trust requires a layered, context-aware approach that integrates both hardware and software safeguards. The study serves as a practical framework for cloud architects and security engineers to reassess key protection strategies in light of evolving threats. To our knowledge, this is the first work to synthesize documented, real-world cloud HSM and TPM failures into a coherent taxonomy grounded in modern threat models.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 Flowcharts, 2 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Distilled Large Language Model in Confidential Computing Environment for System-on-Chip Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16226v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in circuit design tasks and have typically undergone multiple rounds of training. Both the trained models and their associated training data are considered confidential intellectual property (IP) and must be protected from exposure. Confidential Computing offers a promising solution to protect data and models through Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). However, existing TEE implementations are not designed to support the resource-intensive nature of LLMs efficiently. In this work, we first present a comprehensive evaluation of the LLMs within a TEE-enabled confidential computing environment, specifically utilizing Intel Trust Domain Extensions (TDX). We constructed experiments on three environments: TEE-based, CPU-only, and CPU-GPU hybrid implementations, and evaluated their performance in terms of tokens per second. Our first observation is that distilled models, i.e., DeepSeek, surpass other models in performance due to their smaller parameters, making them suitable for resource-constrained devices. Also, in the quantized models such as 4-bit quantization (Q4) and 8-bit quantization (Q8), we observed a performance gain of up to 3x compared to FP16 models. Our findings indicate that for fewer parameter sets, such as DeepSeek-r1-1.5B, the TDX implementation outperforms the CPU version in executing computations within a secure environment. We further validate the results using a testbench designed for SoC design tasks. These validations demonstrate the potential of efficiently deploying lightweight LLMs on resource-constrained systems for semiconductor CAD applications.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures; |
| **[Careful Whisper: Attestation for peer-to-peer Confidential Computing networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14796v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are designed to protect the privacy and integrity of data in use. They enable secure data processing and sharing in peer-to-peer networks, such as vehicular ad hoc networks of autonomous vehicles, without compromising confidentiality. In these networks, nodes must establish mutual trust to collaborate securely. TEEs can achieve this through remote attestation, where a prover presents evidence of its trustworthiness to a verifier, which then decides whether or not to trust the prover. However, a naive peer-to-peer attestation approach, where every TEE directly attests every other TEE, results in quadratic communication overhead. This is inefficient in dynamic environments, where nodes frequently join and leave the network. To address this, we present Careful Whisper, a gossip-based protocol that disseminates trust efficiently, reducing attestation overhead to linear complexity under ideal conditions. It enables interoperability by enabling transitive trust across heterogeneous networks, and supports trust establishment with offline nodes via relayed attestations. Using a custom discrete-event simulator, we show that Careful Whisper propagates trust both faster and more widely than naive approaches across various network topologies. Our results demonstrate that our protocol is resource efficient, sending ~21.5 KiB and requiring 0.158 seconds per round in a 200-node network, and that our protocol is resilient to attestation failures across various network topologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[NVIDIA GPU Confidential Computing Demystified](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02770v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GPU Confidential Computing (GPU-CC) was introduced as part of the NVIDIA Hopper Architecture, extending the trust boundary beyond traditional CPU-based confidential computing. This innovation enables GPUs to securely process AI workloads, providing a robust and efficient solution for handling sensitive data. For end users, transitioning to GPU-CC mode is seamless, requiring no modifications to existing AI applications. However, this ease of adoption contrasts sharply with the complexity of the underlying proprietary systems. The lack of transparency presents significant challenges for security researchers seeking a deeper understanding of GPU-CC's architecture and operational mechanisms. The challenges of analyzing the NVIDIA GPU-CC system arise from a scarcity of detailed specifications, the proprietary nature of the ecosystem, and the complexity of product design. In this paper, we aim to demystify the implementation of NVIDIA GPU-CC system by piecing together the fragmented and incomplete information disclosed from various sources. Our investigation begins with a high-level discussion of the threat model and security principles before delving into the low-level details of each system component. We instrument the GPU kernel module -- the only open-source component of the system -- and conduct a series of experiments to identify the security weaknesses and potential exploits. For certain components that are out of reach through experiments, we propose well-reasoned speculations about their inner working mechanisms. We have responsibly reported all security findings presented in this paper to the NVIDIA PSIRT Team.</p></details> |  |
| **[NanoZone: Scalable, Efficient, and Secure Memory Protection for Arm CCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07034v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Arm Confidential Computing Architecture (CCA) currently isolates at the granularity of an entire Confidential Virtual Machine (CVM), leaving intra-VM bugs such as Heartbleed unmitigated. The state-of-the-art narrows this to the process level, yet still cannot stop attacks that pivot within the same process, and prior intra-enclave schemes are either too slow or incompatible with CVM-style isolation. We extend CCA with a three-tier zone model that spawns an unlimited number of lightweight isolation domains inside a single process, while shielding them from kernel-space adversaries. To block domain-switch abuse, we also add a fast user-level Code-Pointer Integrity (CPI) mechanism. We developed two prototypes: a functional version on Arm's official simulator to validate resistance against intra-process and kernel-space adversaries, and a performance variant on Arm development boards evaluated for session-key isolation within server applications, in-memory key-value protection, and non-volatile-memory data isolation. NanoZone incurs roughly a 20% performance overhead while retaining 95% throughput compared to the system without fine-grained isolation.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenCCA: An Open Framework to Enable Arm CCA Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05129v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential computing has gained traction across major architectures with Intel TDX, AMD SEV-SNP, and Arm CCA. Unlike TDX and SEV-SNP, a key challenge in researching Arm CCA is the absence of hardware support, forcing researchers to develop ad-hoc performance prototypes on non-CCA Arm boards. This approach leads to duplicated efforts, inconsistent performance comparisons, and high barriers to entry. To address this, we present OpenCCA, an open research platform that enables the execution of CCA-bound code on commodity Armv8.2 hardware. By systematically adapting the software stack -- including bootloader, firmware, hypervisor, and kernel -- OpenCCA emulates CCA operations for performance evaluation while preserving functional correctness. We demonstrate its effectiveness with typical life-cycle measurements and case-studies inspired by prior CCA-based papers on a easily available Armv8.2 Rockchip board that costs $250.</p></details> |  |
| **[Performance of Confidential Computing GPUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16501v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work examines latency, throughput, and other metrics when performing inference on confidential GPUs. We explore different traffic patterns and scheduling strategies using a single Virtual Machine with one NVIDIA H100 GPU, to perform relaxed batch inferences on multiple Large Language Models (LLMs), operating under the constraint of swapping models in and out of memory, which necessitates efficient control. The experiments simulate diverse real-world scenarios by varying parameters such as traffic load, traffic distribution patterns, scheduling strategies, and Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements. The findings provide insights into the differences between confidential and non-confidential settings when performing inference in scenarios requiring active model swapping. Results indicate that in No-CC mode, relaxed batch inference with model swapping latency is 20-30% lower than in confidential mode. Additionally, SLA attainment is 15-20% higher in No-CC settings. Throughput in No-CC scenarios surpasses that of confidential mode by 45-70%, and GPU utilization is approximately 50% higher in No-CC environments. Overall, performance in the confidential setting is inferior to that in the No-CC scenario, primarily due to the additional encryption and decryption overhead required for loading models onto the GPU in confidential environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 tables.

We argue that it can also be leveraged to build safer and more secure mission-critical embedded systems. In this paper, we introduce the Assured Confidential Execution (ACE), an open-source and royalty-free confidential computing technology targeted for embedded RISC-V systems. We present a set of principles and a methodology that we used to build \ACE and that might be applied for developing other embedded systems that require formal verification. An evaluation of our prototype on the first available RISC-V hardware supporting virtualization indicates that ACE is a viable candidate for our target systems.</p></details> |  |

This survey offers a comprehensive overview of privacy risks associated with LLMs and examines current solutions to mitigate these challenges. First, we analyze privacy leakage and attacks in LLMs, focusing on how these models unintentionally expose sensitive information through techniques such as model inversion, training data extraction, and membership inference. We investigate the mechanisms of privacy leakage, including the unauthorized extraction of training data and the potential exploitation of these vulnerabilities by malicious actors. Next, we review existing privacy protection against such risks, such as inference detection, federated learning, backdoor mitigation, and confidential computing, and assess their effectiveness in preventing privacy leakage. Furthermore, we highlight key practical challenges and propose future research directions to develop secure and privacy-preserving LLMs, emphasizing privacy risk assessment, secure knowledge transfer between models, and interdisciplinary frameworks for privacy governance. Ultimately, this survey aims to establish a roadmap for addressing escalating privacy challenges in the LLMs domain.</p></details> |  |

However, ensuring complex computations with low gas fees and confidentiality remains challenging. Recent advances in Confidential Computing -- leveraging hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) -- and Proof-carrying Data -- employing cryptographic Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machines (zkVMs) -- hold promise for secure, privacy-preserving off-chain and layer-2 computations. On the other side, a homogeneous reliance on a single technology, such as TEEs or zkVMs, is impractical for decentralized environments with heterogeneous computational requirements. This paper introduces the Trusted Compute Unit (TCU), a unifying framework that enables composable and interoperable verifiable computations across heterogeneous technologies. Our approach allows decentralized applications (dApps) to flexibly offload complex computations to TCUs, obtaining proof of correctness. These proofs can be anchored on-chain for automated dApp interactions, while ensuring confidentiality of input data, and integrity of output data. We demonstrate how TCUs can support a prominent blockchain use case, such as federated learning. By enabling secure off-chain interactions without incurring on-chain confirmation delays or gas fees, TCUs significantly improve system performance and scalability. Experimental insights and performance evaluations confirm the feasibility and practicality of this unified approach, advancing the state of the art in verifiable off-chain services for the blockchain ecosystem.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in 2025 IEEE International Conference on Blockchain and Cryptocurrency (ICBC'25). 9 pages. 4 figures</p></details> |

Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are a practical solution for protecting proprietary models, yet existing TEE solutions have architectural constraints that hinder on-device model deployment. Arm Confidential Computing Architecture (CCA), a new Arm extension, addresses several of these limitations and shows promise as a secure platform for on-device ML. In this paper, we evaluate the performance-privacy trade-offs of deploying models within CCA, highlighting its potential to enable confidential and efficient ML applications. Our evaluations show that CCA can achieve an overhead of, at most, 22% in running models of different sizes and applications, including image classification, voice recognition, and chat assistants. This performance overhead comes with privacy benefits; for example, our framework can successfully protect the model against membership inference attack by an 8.3% reduction in the adversary's success rate. To support further research and early adoption, we make our code and methodology publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 8th Workshop on System Software for Trusted Execution (SysTEX 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Transparent Attested DNS for Confidential Computing Services](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14611v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential services running in hardware-protected Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) can provide higher security assurance, but this requires custom clients and protocols to distribute, update, and verify their attestation evidence. Compared with classic Internet security, built upon universal abstractions such as domain names, origins, and certificates, this puts a significant burden on service users and providers. In particular, Web browsers and other legacy clients do not get the same security guaranties as custom clients. We present a new approach for users to establish trust in confidential services. We propose attested DNS (aDNS): a name service that securely binds the attested implementation of confidential services to their domain names. ADNS enforces policies for all names in its zone of authority: any TEE that runs a service must present hardware attestation that complies with the domain-specific policy before registering keys and obtaining certificates for any name in this domain. ADNS provides protocols for zone delegation, TEE registration, and certificate issuance. ADNS builds on standards such as DNSSEC, DANE, ACME and Certificate Transparency. ADNS provides DNS transparency by keeping all records, policies, and attestations in a public append-only log, thereby enabling auditing and preventing targeted attacks. We implement aDNS as a confidential service using a fault-tolerant network of TEEs. We evaluate it using sample confidential services that illustrate various TEE platforms. On the client side, we provide a generic browser extension that queries and verifies attestation records before opening TLS connections, with negligible performance overhead, and we show that, with aDNS, even legacy Web clients benefit from confidential computing as long as some enlightened clients verify attestations to deter or blame malicious actors.</p></details> |  |
| **[TFHE-Coder: Evaluating LLM-agentic Fully Homomorphic Encryption Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12217v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the torus (TFHE) enables computation on encrypted data without decryption, making it a cornerstone of secure and confidential computing. Despite its potential in privacy preserving machine learning, secure multi party computation, private blockchain transactions, and secure medical diagnostics, its adoption remains limited due to cryptographic complexity and usability challenges. While various TFHE libraries and compilers exist, practical code generation remains a hurdle. We propose a compiler integrated framework to evaluate LLM inference and agentic optimization for TFHE code generation, focusing on logic gates and ReLU activation. Our methodology assesses error rates, compilability, and structural similarity across open and closedsource LLMs. Results highlight significant limitations in off-the-shelf models, while agentic optimizations such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and few-shot prompting reduce errors and enhance code fidelity. This work establishes the first benchmark for TFHE code generation, demonstrating how LLMs, when augmented with domain-specific feedback, can bridge the expertise gap in FHE code generation.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[SoK: A cloudy view on trust relationships of CVMs -- How Confidential Virtual Machines are falling short in Public Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08256v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential computing in the public cloud intends to safeguard workload privacy while outsourcing infrastructure management to a cloud provider. This is achieved by executing customer workloads within so called Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), such as Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs), which protect them from unauthorized access by cloud administrators and privileged system software. At the core of confidential computing lies remote attestation -- a mechanism that enables workload owners to verify the initial state of their workload and furthermore authenticate the underlying hardware. hile this represents a significant advancement in cloud security, this SoK critically examines the confidential computing offerings of market-leading cloud providers to assess whether they genuinely adhere to its core principles. We develop a taxonomy based on carefully selected criteria to systematically evaluate these offerings, enabling us to analyse the components responsible for remote attestation, the evidence provided at each stage, the extent of cloud provider influence and whether this undermines the threat model of confidential computing. Specifically, we investigate how CVMs are deployed in the public cloud infrastructures, the extent to which customers can request and verify attestation evidence, and their ability to define and enforce configuration and attestation requirements. This analysis provides insight into whether confidential computing guarantees -- namely confidentiality and integrity -- are genuinely upheld. Our findings reveal that all major cloud providers retain control over critical parts of the trusted software stack and, in some cases, intervene in the standard remote attestation process. This directly contradicts their claims of delivering confidential computing, as the model fundamentally excludes the cloud provider from the set of trusted entities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training Differentially Private Models with Secure Multiparty Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02625v4)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of learning a machine learning model from training data that originates at multiple data owners while providing formal privacy guarantees regarding the protection of each owner's data. Existing solutions based on Differential Privacy (DP) achieve this at the cost of a drop in accuracy. Solutions based on Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) do not incur such accuracy loss but leak information when the trained model is made publicly available. We propose an MPC solution for training DP models. Our solution relies on an MPC protocol for model training, and an MPC protocol for perturbing the trained model coefficients with Laplace noise in a privacy-preserving manner. The resulting MPC+DP approach achieves higher accuracy than a pure DP approach while providing the same formal privacy guarantees. Our work obtained first place in the iDASH2021 Track III competition on confidential computing for secure genome analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Locking Machine Learning Models into Hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20990v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern machine learning (ML) models are expensive IP and business competitiveness often depends on keeping this IP confidential. This in turn restricts how these models are deployed; for example, it is unclear how to deploy a model on-device without inevitably leaking the underlying model. At the same time, confidential computing technologies such as multi-party computation or homomorphic encryption remain impractical for wide adoption. In this paper, we take a different approach and investigate the feasibility of ML-specific mechanisms that deter unauthorized model use by restricting the model to only be usable on specific hardware, making adoption on unauthorized hardware inconvenient. That way, even if IP is compromised, it cannot be trivially used without specialised hardware or major model adjustment. In a sense, we seek to enable cheap \emph{locking of machine learning models into specific hardware}. We demonstrate that \emph{locking} mechanisms are feasible by either targeting efficiency of model representations, making such models incompatible with quantization, or tying the model's operation to specific characteristics of hardware, such as the number of clock cycles for arithmetic operations. We demonstrate that locking comes with negligible overheads, while significantly restricting usability of the resultant model on unauthorized hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures of main text; 9 pages, 12 figures of appendices</p></details> |
| **[Laminator: Verifiable ML Property Cards using Hardware-assisted Attestations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17548v3)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Regulations increasingly call for various assurances from machine learning (ML) model providers about their training data, training process, and model behavior. For better transparency, industry (e.g., Huggingface and Google) has adopted model cards and datasheets to describe various properties of training datasets and models. In the same vein, we introduce the notion of inference cards to describe the properties of a given inference (e.g., binding of the output to the model and its corresponding input). We coin the term ML property cards to collectively refer to these various types of cards. To prevent a malicious model provider from including false information in ML property cards, they need to be verifiable. We show how to construct verifiable ML property cards using property attestation, technical mechanisms by which a prover (e.g., a model provider) can attest to various ML properties to a verifier (e.g., an auditor). Since prior attestation mechanisms based purely on cryptography are often narrowly focused (lacking versatility) and inefficient, we need an efficient mechanism to attest different types of properties across the entire ML model pipeline. Emerging widespread support for confidential computing has made it possible to run and even train models inside hardware-assisted trusted execution environments (TEEs), which provide highly efficient attestation mechanisms. We propose Laminator, which uses TEEs to provide the first framework for verifiable ML property cards via hardware-assisted ML property attestations. Laminator is efficient in terms of overhead, scalable to large numbers of verifiers, and versatile with respect to the properties it can prove during training or inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM C...</summary><p>ACM Conference on Data and Application Security and Privacy (CODASPY), 2025</p></details> |

Confidential computing, enabled by Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), offers a promising solution to mitigate these risks. However, existing TEE implementations, primarily CPU-based, struggle to efficiently support the resource-intensive nature of LLM inference and training. In this work, we present the first evaluation of the DeepSeek model within a TEE-enabled confidential computing environment, specifically utilizing Intel Trust Domain Extensions (TDX). Our study benchmarks DeepSeek's performance across CPU-only, CPU-GPU hybrid, and TEE-based implementations. For smaller parameter sets, such as DeepSeek-R1-1.5B, the TDX implementation outperforms the CPU version in executing computations within a secure environment. It highlights the potential for efficiently deploying LLM models on resource-constrained systems while ensuring security. The overall GPU-to-CPU performance ratio averages 12 across different model sizes, with smaller models exhibiting a lower ratio. Additionally, we provide foundational insights and guidance on optimizing CPU-GPU confidential computing solutions for scalable and secure AI deployments. Our findings contribute to the advancement of privacy-preserving AI, paving the way for efficient and secure LLM inference in confidential computing environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatic ISA analysis for Secure Context Switching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06609v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction set architectures are complex, with hundreds of registers and instructions that can modify dozens of them during execution, variably on each instance. Prose-style ISA specifications struggle to capture these intricacies of the ISAs, where often the important details about a single register are spread out across hundreds of pages of documentation. Ensuring that all ISA-state is swapped in context switch implementations of privileged software requires meticulous examination of these pages. This manual process is tedious and error-prone. We propose a tool called Sailor that leverages machine-readable ISA specifications written in Sail to automate this task. Sailor determines the ISA-state necessary to swap during the context switch using the data collected from Sail and a novel algorithm to classify ISA-state as security-sensitive. Using Sailor's output, we identify three different classes of mishandled ISA-state across four open-source confidential computing systems. We further reveal five distinct security vulnerabilities that can be exploited using the mishandled ISA-state. This research exposes an often overlooked attack surface that stems from mishandled ISA-state, enabling unprivileged adversaries to exploit system vulnerabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, 4 listings</p></details> |

Motivated by the pervasive reliance on single service providers for data storage and computation, we propose a privacy-preserving scheme that achieves information-theoretic security guarantees for computing polynomials over non-uniform data distributions. Our framework builds upon the concept of perfect subset privacy and employs linear hashing techniques to transform non-uniform data into approximately uniform distributions, enabling robust and secure computation. We derive leakage bounds and demonstrate that information leakage of any subset of user data to untrusted service providers, i.e., not only to colluding workers but also (and more importantly) to the admin, remains negligible under the proposed scheme.</p></details> | <details><summary>Parts...</summary><p>Parts of this work were submitted to ISIT 2025</p></details> |

However, FL introduces the need for additional security measures as FL alone is still subject to vulnerabilities such as model and data poisoning and inference attacks. Confidential Computing (CC) is a paradigm that, by leveraging hardware-based trusted execution environments (TEEs), protects the confidentiality and integrity of ML models and data, thus resulting in a powerful ally of FL applications. Typical TEEs offer an application-isolation level but suffer many drawbacks, such as limited available memory and debugging and coding difficulties. The new generation of TEEs offers a virtual machine (VM)-based isolation level, thus reducing the porting effort for existing applications. In this work, we compare the performance of VM-based and application-isolation level TEEs for confidential FL (CFL) applications. In particular, we evaluate the impact of TEEs and additional security mechanisms such as TLS (for securing the communication channel). The results, obtained across three datasets and two deep learning models, demonstrate that the new VM-based TEEs introduce a limited overhead (at most 1.5x), thus paving the way to leverage public and untrusted computing environments, such as HPC facilities or public cloud, without detriment to performance.</p></details> |  |

Hereby, the finetuning is conducted offsite, i.e., on the computation infrastructure of a third-party cloud provider. We tackle this problem by proposing ObfuscaTune, a novel, efficient and fully utility-preserving approach that combines a simple yet effective obfuscation technique with an efficient usage of confidential computing (only 5% of the model parameters are placed on TEE). We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of ObfuscaTune by validating it on GPT-2 models with different sizes on four NLP benchmark datasets. Finally, we compare to a naïve version of our approach to highlight the necessity of using random matrices with low condition numbers in our approach to reduce errors induced by the obfuscation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2025 (PPAI Workshop)</p></details> |

In this work, we develop the first, comprehensive symbolic model of the software interface of the latest SEV iteration called SEV Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP). Our model covers remote attestation, key derivation, page swap and live migration. We analyze the security of the software interface of SEV-SNP and formally prove that most critical secrecy, authentication, attestation and freshness properties do indeed hold in the model. Furthermore, we find that the platform-agnostic nature of messages exchanged between SNP guests and the AMD Secure Processor firmware presents a potential weakness in the design. We show how this weakness leads to formal attacks on multiple security properties, including the partial compromise of attestation report integrity, and discuss possible impacts and mitigations.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has quickly become a feasible solution for organizations looking to overcome the challenges of maintaining proprietary models and to help reduce LLM hallucinations in their query responses. However, RAG comes with its own issues regarding scaling data pipelines across tiered-access and disparate data sources. In many scenarios, it is necessary to query beyond a single data silo to provide richer and more relevant context for an LLM. Analyzing data sources within and across organizational trust boundaries is often limited by complex data-sharing policies that prohibit centralized data storage, therefore, inhibit the fast and effective setup and scaling of RAG solutions. In this paper, we introduce Confidential Computing (CC) techniques as a solution for secure Federated Retrieval Augmented Generation (FedRAG). Our proposed Confidential FedRAG system (C-FedRAG) enables secure connection and scaling of a RAG workflows across a decentralized network of data providers by ensuring context confidentiality. We also demonstrate how to implement a C-FedRAG system using the NVIDIA FLARE SDK and assess its performance using the MedRAG toolkit and MIRAGE benchmarking dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[CCxTrust: Confidential Computing Platform Based on TEE and TPM Collaborative Trust](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03842v3)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential Computing has emerged to address data security challenges in cloud-centric deployments by protecting data in use through hardware-level isolation. However, reliance on a single hardware root of trust (RoT) limits user confidence in cloud platforms, especially for high-performance AI services, where end-to-end protection of sensitive models and data is critical. Furthermore, the lack of interoperability and a unified trust model in multi-cloud environments prevents the establishment of a cross-platform, cross-cloud chain of trust, creating a significant trust gap for users with high privacy requirements. To address the challenges mentioned above, this paper proposes CCxTrust (Confidential Computing with Trust), a confidential computing platform leveraging collaborative roots of trust from TEE and TPM. CCxTrust combines the black-box RoT embedded in the CPU-TEE with the flexible white-box RoT of TPM to establish a collaborative trust framework. The platform implements independent Roots of Trust for Measurement (RTM) for TEE and TPM, and a collaborative Root of Trust for Report (RTR) for composite attestation. The Root of Trust for Storage (RTS) is solely supported by TPM. We also present the design and implementation of a confidential TPM supporting multiple modes for secure use within confidential virtual machines. Additionally, we propose a composite attestation protocol integrating TEE and TPM to enhance security and attestation efficiency, which is proven secure under the PCL protocol security model. We implemented a prototype of CCxTrust on a confidential computing server with AMD SEV-SNP and TPM chips, requiring minimal modifications to the TPM and guest Linux kernel. The composite attestation efficiency improved by 24% without significant overhead, while Confidential TPM performance showed a 16.47% reduction compared to standard TPM.</p></details> | 23 pages, 14 figures |
| **[A Confidential Computing Transparency Framework for a Comprehensive Trust Chain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03720v2)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential Computing enhances privacy of data in-use through hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) that use attestation to verify their integrity, authenticity, and certain runtime properties, along with those of the binaries they execute. However, TEEs require user trust, as attestation alone cannot guarantee the absence of vulnerabilities or backdoors. Enhanced transparency can mitigate the reliance on naive trust. Some organisations currently employ various transparency measures, including open-source firmware, publishing technical documentation, or undergoing external audits, but these require investments with unclear returns. This may discourage the adoption of transparency, leaving users with limited visibility into system privacy measures. Additionally, the lack of standardisation complicates meaningful comparisons between implementations. To address these challenges, we propose a three-level conceptual framework providing organisations with a practical pathway to incrementally improve Confidential Computing transparency. To evaluate whether our transparency framework contributes to an increase in end-user trust, we conducted an empirical study with over 800 non-expert participants. The results indicate that greater transparency improves user comfort, with participants willing to share various types of personal data across different levels of transparency. The study also reveals misconceptions about transparency, highlighting the need for clear communication and user education.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blindfold: Confidential Memory Management by Untrusted Operating System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01059v3)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential Computing (CC) has received increasing attention in recent years as a mechanism to protect user data from untrusted operating systems (OSes). Existing CC solutions hide confidential memory from the OS and/or encrypt it to achieve confidentiality. In doing so, they render OS memory optimization unusable or complicate the trusted computing base (TCB) required for optimization. This paper presents our results toward overcoming these limitations, synthesized in a CC design named Blindfold. Like many other CC solutions, Blindfold relies on a small trusted software component running at a higher privilege level than the kernel, called Guardian. It features three techniques that can enhance existing CC solutions. First, instead of nesting page tables, Guardian mediates how the OS accesses memory and handles exceptions by switching page and interrupt tables. Second, Blindfold employs a lightweight capability system to regulate the kernel semantic access to user memory, unifying case-by-case approaches in previous work. Finally, Blindfold provides carefully designed secure ABI for confidential memory management without encryption. We report an implementation of Blindfold that works on ARMv8-A/Linux. Using Blindfold prototype, we are able to evaluate the cost of enabling confidential memory management by the untrusted Linux kernel. We show Blindfold has a smaller runtime TCB than related systems and enjoys competitive performance. More importantly, we show that the Linux kernel, including all of its memory optimizations except memory compression, can function properly for confidential memory. This requires only about 400 lines of kernel modifications.</p></details> |  |

Indeed, many hail the combination of TEEs and blockchains a good "marriage": TEEs bring confidential computing to the blockchain while the consensus layer could help defend TEEs from forking attacks. In this paper, we systemize how current blockchain solutions integrate TEEs and to what extent they are secure against forking attacks. To do so, we thoroughly analyze 29 proposals for TEE-based blockchains, ranging from academic proposals to production-ready platforms. We uncover a lack of consensus in the community on how to combine TEEs and blockchains. In particular, we identify four broad means to interconnect TEEs with consensus, analyze their limitations, and discuss possible remedies. Our analysis also reveals previously undocumented forking attacks on three production-ready TEE-based blockchains: Ten, Phala, and the Secret Network. We leverage our analysis to propose effective countermeasures against those vulnerabilities; we responsibly disclosed our findings to the developers of each affected platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 14 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

We benchmark the overhead introduced by TEE mode across various LLMs and token lengths, with a particular focus on the bottleneck caused by CPU-GPU data transfers via PCIe.

Nonetheless, this encryption incurs a significant performance overhead, reaching up to 52.8 percent and 88.2 percent throughput drop when serving OPT-30B and OPT-66B, respectively. To address this challenge, we introduce PipeLLM, a user-transparent runtime system. PipeLLM removes the overhead by overlapping the encryption and GPU computation through pipelining - an idea inspired by the CPU instruction pipelining - thereby effectively concealing the latency increase caused by encryption. The primary technical challenge is that, unlike CPUs, the encryption module lacks prior knowledge of the specific data needing encryption until it is requested by the GPUs. To this end, we propose speculative pipelined encryption to predict the data requiring encryption by analyzing the serving patterns of LLMs. Further, we have developed an efficient, low-cost pipeline relinquishing approach for instances of incorrect predictions. Our experiments on NVIDIA H100 GPU show that compared with vanilla systems without confidential computing (e.g., vLLM, PEFT, and FlexGen), PipeLLM incurs modest overhead (less than 19.6 percent in throughput) across various LLM sizes, from 13B to 175B.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ASPLOS 2025</p></details> |

Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) offer a promising solution by creating secure environments that protect data and code from such threats. The rise of confidential computing on cloud platforms facilitates the deployment of TEE-enabled server applications, which are expected to be widely adopted in web services such as privacy-preserving LLM inference and secure data logging. One key feature is Remote Attestation (RA), which enables integrity verification of a TEE. However, $\textit{compatibility}$ issues with RA verification arise as no browsers natively support this feature, making prior solutions cumbersome and risky. To address these challenges, we propose $\texttt{RA-WEBs}$ ($\textbf{R}$emote $\textbf{A}$ttestation for $\textbf{Web}$ $\textbf{s}$ervices), a novel RA protocol designed for high compatibility with the current web ecosystem. $\texttt{RA-WEBs}$ leverages established web mechanisms for immediate deployability, enabling RA verification on existing browsers. We conduct a comprehensive security analysis, demonstrating $\texttt{RA-WEBs}$'s resilience against various threats. Our contributions include the $\texttt{RA-WEBs}$ proposal, a proof-of-concept implementation, an in-depth security analysis, and publicly available code for reproducible research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Decentralized AI with Confidential Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13752v2)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses privacy protection in decentralized Artificial Intelligence (AI) using Confidential Computing (CC) within the Atoma Network, a decentralized AI platform designed for the Web3 domain. Decentralized AI distributes AI services among multiple entities without centralized oversight, fostering transparency and robustness. However, this structure introduces significant privacy challenges, as sensitive assets such as proprietary models and personal data may be exposed to untrusted participants. Cryptography-based privacy protection techniques such as zero-knowledge machine learning (zkML) suffers prohibitive computational overhead. To address the limitation, we propose leveraging Confidential Computing (CC). Confidential Computing leverages hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to provide isolation for processing sensitive data, ensuring that both model parameters and user data remain secure, even in decentralized, potentially untrusted environments. While TEEs face a few limitations, we believe they can bridge the privacy gap in decentralized AI. We explore how we can integrate TEEs into Atoma's decentralized framework.</p></details> |  |

Although CVMs have been widely adopted by major cloud service providers, current CVM designs face significant challenges in runtime resource management due to their fixed capacities and lack of transparency. These limitations hamper efficient cloud resource management, leading to increased operational costs and reduced agility in responding to fluctuating workloads. This paper introduces a dynamic CPU resource management approach, featuring the novel concept of "Elastic CVM. This approach allows for hypervisor-assisted runtime adjustment of CPU resources using a specialized vCPU type, termed Worker vCPU. This new approach enhances CPU resource adaptability and operational efficiency without compromising security. Additionally, we introduce a Worker vCPU Abstraction Layer to simplify Worker vCPU deployment and management. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we have designed and implemented a serverless computing prototype platform, called Ditto. We show that Ditto significantly improves performance and efficiency through finergrain resource management. The concept of "Elastic CVM" and the Worker vCPU design not only optimize cloud resource utilization but also pave the way for more flexible and cost-effective confidential computing environments.</p></details> |  |

However, managing heterogeneous and intermittent resources to support machine/deep learning (ML/DL) based workflows poses challenges in resource governance for reliability, and confidentiality for model/data privacy protection. There is a need for approaches to handle the volatility of volunteer edge node availability, and also to scale the confidential data-intensive workflow execution across a large number of VEC nodes. In this paper, we present VECA, a reliable and confidential VEC resource clustering solution featuring three-fold methods tailored for executing ML/DL-based scientific workflows on VEC resources. Firstly, a capacity-based clustering approach enhances system reliability and minimizes VEC node search latency. Secondly, a novel two-phase, globally distributed scheduling scheme optimizes job allocation based on node attributes and using time-series-based Recurrent Neural Networks. Lastly, the integration of confidential computing ensures privacy preservation of the scientific workflows, where model and data information are not shared with VEC resources providers. We evaluate VECA in a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) cloud testbed that features OpenFaaS and MicroK8S to support two ML/DL-based scientific workflows viz., G2P-Deep (bioinformatics) and PAS-ML (health informatics). Results from tested experiments demonstrate that our proposed VECA approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods; especially VECA exhibits a two-fold reduction in VEC node search latency and over 20% improvement in productivity rates following execution failures compared to the next best method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted - IC2E 2024 Conference</p></details> |

The combination of CPU and GPU is particularly popular due to its versatility. However, these heterogeneous systems face significant security and privacy risks. Advances in privacy-preserving techniques, especially hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), offer effective protection for GPU applications. Nonetheless, the potential security risks involved in extending TEEs to GPUs in heterogeneous systems remain uncertain and need further investigation. To investigate these risks in depth, we study the existing popular GPU TEE designs and summarize and compare their key implications. Additionally, we review existing powerful attacks on GPUs and traditional TEEs deployed on CPUs, along with the efforts to mitigate these threats. We identify potential attack surfaces introduced by GPU TEEs and provide insights into key considerations for designing secure GPU TEEs. This survey is timely as new TEEs for heterogeneous systems, particularly GPUs, are being developed, highlighting the need to understand potential security threats and build both efficient and secure systems.</p></details> | 35 pages, 7 figures |

While significantly improving the performance of the mobile applications, the cloud-based mechanism often causes privacy concerns as the multimedia data and services are offloaded from the trusted user device to untrusted cloud servers. Several recent studies have proposed perturbation-based privacy preserving mechanisms, which obfuscate the offloaded multimedia data to eliminate privacy exposures without affecting the functionality of the remote multimedia services. However, the existing privacy protection approaches require the deployment of computation-intensive perturbation generation on the resource-constrained mobile devices. Also, the obfuscated images are typically not compliant with the standard image compression algorithms and suffer from significant bandwidth consumption. In this paper, we develop a novel privacy-preserving multimedia mobile cloud computing framework, namely $PMC^2$, to address the resource and bandwidth challenges. $PMC^2$ employs secure confidential computing in the cloud to deploy the perturbation generator, which addresses the resource challenge while maintaining the privacy. Furthermore, we develop a neural compressor specifically trained to compress the perturbed images in order to address the bandwidth challenge. We implement $PMC^2$ in an end-to-end mobile cloud computing system, based on which our evaluations demonstrate superior latency, power efficiency, and bandwidth consumption achieved by $PMC^2$ while maintaining high accuracy in the target multimedia service.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present Devlore which allows realm VMs to directly access integrated peripherals. Devlore memory isolation re-purposes CCA hardware primitives (granule protection and stage-two page tables), while our interrupt isolation adapts a delegate-but-check strategy. Our choice of offloading interrupt management to the hypervisor but adding correctness checks in the trusted software allows Devlore to preserve compatibility and performance. We evaluate Devlore on Arm FVP to demonstrate 5 diverse peripherals attached to realm VMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aster: Fixing the Android TEE Ecosystem with Arm CCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16694v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Android ecosystem relies on either TrustZone (e.g., OP-TEE, QTEE, Trusty) or trusted hypervisors (pKVM, Gunyah) to isolate security-sensitive services from malicious apps and Android bugs. TrustZone allows any secure world code to access the normal world that runs Android. Similarly, a trusted hypervisor has full access to Android running in one VM and security services in other VMs. In this paper, we motivate the need for mutual isolation, wherein Android, hypervisors, and the secure world are isolated from each other. Then, we propose a sandboxed service abstraction, such that a sandboxed execution cannot access any other sandbox, Android, hypervisor, or secure world memory. We present Aster which achieves these goals while ensuring that sandboxed execution can still communicate with Android to get inputs and provide outputs securely. Our main insight is to leverage the hardware isolation offered by Arm Confidential Computing Architecture (CCA). However, since CCA does not satisfy our sandboxing and mutual isolation requirements, Aster repurposes its hardware enforcement to meet its goals while addressing challenges such as secure interfaces, virtio, and protection against interrupts. We implement Aster to demonstrate its feasibility and assess its compatibility. We take three case studies, including one currently deployed on Android phones and insufficiently secured using a trusted hypervisor, to demonstrate that they can be protected by Aster.</p></details> |  |

Its journey typically flows from collection to transport, storage, management and processing. While best practices and regulations guide data management and protection, recent events have underscored its vulnerability. Academic research and commercial data handling have been marred by scandals, revealing the brittleness of data management. Data, despite its importance, is susceptible to undue disclosures, leaks, losses, manipulation, or fabrication. These incidents often occur without visibility or accountability, necessitating a systematic structure for safe, honest, and auditable data management. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Honest Computing as the practice and approach that emphasizes transparency, integrity, and ethical behaviour within the realm of computing and technology. It ensures that computer systems and software operate honestly and reliably without hidden agendas, biases, or unethical practices. It enables privacy and confidentiality of data and code by design and by default. We also introduce a reference framework to achieve demonstrable data lineage and provenance, contrasting it with Secure Computing, a related but differently-orientated form of computing. At its core, Honest Computing leverages Trustless Computing, Confidential Computing, Distributed Computing, Cryptography and AAA security concepts. Honest Computing opens new ways of creating technology-based processes and workflows which permit the migration of regulatory frameworks for data protection from principle-based approaches to rule-based ones. Addressing use cases in many fields, from AI model protection and ethical layering to digital currency formation for finance and banking, trading, and healthcare, this foundational layer approach can help define new standards for appropriate data custody and processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Data & Policy journal</p></details> |
| **[Cabin: Confining Untrusted Programs within Confidential VMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12334v2)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential computing safeguards sensitive computations from untrusted clouds, with Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs) providing a secure environment for guest OS. However, CVMs often come with large and vulnerable operating system kernels, making them susceptible to attacks exploiting kernel weaknesses. The imprecise control over the read/write access in the page table has allowed attackers to exploit vulnerabilities. The lack of security hierarchy leads to insufficient separation between untrusted applications and guest OS, making the kernel susceptible to direct threats from untrusted programs. This study proposes Cabin, an isolated execution framework within guest VM utilizing the latest AMD SEV-SNP technology. Cabin shields untrusted processes to the user space of a lower virtual machine privilege level (VMPL) by introducing a proxy-kernel between the confined processes and the guest OS. Furthermore, we propose execution protection mechanisms based on fine-gained control of VMPL privilege for vulnerable programs and the proxy-kernel to minimize the attack surface. We introduce asynchronous forwarding mechanism and anonymous memory management to reduce the performance impact. The evaluation results show that the Cabin framework incurs a modest overhead (5% on average) on Nbench and WolfSSL benchmarks.</p></details> | ICICS 2024 |
| **[Ascend-CC: Confidential Computing on Heterogeneous NPU for Emerging Generative AI Workloads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11888v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud workloads have dominated generative AI based on large language models (LLM). Specialized hardware accelerators, such as GPUs, NPUs, and TPUs, play a key role in AI adoption due to their superior performance over general-purpose CPUs. The AI models and the data are often highly sensitive and come from mutually distrusting parties. Existing CPU-based TEEs such as Intel SGX or AMD SEV do not provide sufficient protection. Device-centric TEEs like Nvidia-CC only address tightly coupled CPU-GPU systems with a proprietary solution requiring TEE on the host CPU side. On the other hand, existing academic proposals are tailored toward specific CPU-TEE platforms. To address this gap, we propose Ascend-CC, a confidential computing architecture based on discrete NPU devices that requires no trust in the host system. Ascend-CC provides strong security by ensuring data and model encryption that protects not only the data but also the model parameters and operator binaries. Ascend-CC uses delegation-based memory semantics to ensure isolation from the host software stack, and task attestation provides strong model integrity guarantees. Our Ascend-CC implementation and evaluation with state-of-the-art LLMs such as Llama2 and Llama3 shows that Ascend-CC introduces minimal overhead with no changes in the AI software stack.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enabling Performant and Secure EDA as a Service in Public Clouds Using Confidential Containers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06040v1)** | 2024-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Increasingly, business opportunities available to fabless design teams in the semiconductor industry far exceed those addressable with on-prem compute resources. An attractive option to capture these electronic design automation (EDA) design opportunities is through public cloud bursting. However, security concerns with public cloud bursting arise from having to protect process design kits, third party intellectual property, and new design data for semiconductor devices and chips. One way to address security concerns for public cloud bursting is to leverage confidential containers for EDA workloads. Confidential containers add zero trust computing elements to significantly reduce the probability of intellectual property escapes. A key concern that often follows security discussions is whether EDA workload performance will suffer with confidential computing. In this work we demonstrate a full set of EDA confidential containers and their deployment and characterize performance impacts of confidential elements of the flow including storage and networking. A complete end-to-end confidential container-based EDA workload exhibits 7.13% and 2.05% performance overheads over bare-metal container and VM based solutions, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, recent work has pointed out that the majority of the open source benchmarks available today have been contaminated or leaked into LLMs, meaning that LLMs have access to test data during pretraining and/or fine-tuning. This raises serious concerns about the validity of benchmarking studies conducted so far and the future of evaluation using benchmarks. To solve this problem, we propose Private Benchmarking, a solution where test datasets are kept private and models are evaluated without revealing the test data to the model. We describe various scenarios (depending on the trust placed on model owners or dataset owners), and present solutions to avoid data contamination using private benchmarking. For scenarios where the model weights need to be kept private, we describe solutions from confidential computing and cryptography that can aid in private benchmarking. We build an end-to-end system, TRUCE, that enables such private benchmarking showing that the overheads introduced to protect models and benchmark are negligible (in the case of confidential computing) and tractable (when cryptographic security is required). Finally, we also discuss solutions to the problem of benchmark dataset auditing, to ensure that private benchmarks are of sufficiently high quality.</p></details> |  |

Previous work applies formal techniques to verify the specification and prototype reference implementation of RMM. However, relying solely on a single verification tool may lead to the oversight of certain bugs or vulnerabilities. This paper discusses the application of ESBMC, a state-of-the-art Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)-based software model checker, to further enhance RRM verification. We demonstrate ESBMC's ability to precisely parse the source code and identify specification failures within a reasonable time frame. Moreover, we propose potential improvements for ESBMC to enhance its efficiency for industry engineers. This work contributes to exploring the capabilities of formal verification techniques in real-world scenarios and suggests avenues for further improvements to better meet industrial verification needs.</p></details> |  |

As a mature system-oriented approach, Confidential Computing has been utilized in both academia and industry to mitigate privacy and security issues in various ML scenarios. In this paper, the conjunction between ML and Confidential Computing is investigated. We systematize the prior work on Confidential Computing-assisted ML techniques that provide i) confidentiality guarantees and ii) integrity assurances, and discuss their advanced features and drawbacks. Key challenges are further identified, and we provide dedicated analyses of the limitations in existing Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) systems for ML use cases. Finally, prospective works are discussed, including grounded privacy definitions for closed-loop protection, partitioned executions of efficient ML, dedicated TEE-assisted designs for ML, TEE-aware ML, and ML full pipeline guarantees. By providing these potential solutions in our systematization of knowledge, we aim to build the bridge to help achieve a much stronger TEE-enabled ML for privacy guarantees without introducing computation and system costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Surve...</summary><p>Survey paper, 37 pages, accepted to ACM Computing Surveys</p></details> |

One finding is that the "performance tax" for such confidential analytical processing is acceptable compared to not using these technologies. We eventually manage to run TPC-H SF30 with under 2x overhead compared to non-encrypted, non-enclave execution; we show that, specifically, columnar compression and encryption are a good combination. Our second finding consists of dos and don'ts to tune DuckDB to work effectively in this environment. There are various performance hazards: potentially 5x higher cache miss costs due to memory encryption inside the enclave, NUMA penalties, and highly elevated cost of swapping pages in and out of the enclave -- which is also triggered indirectly by using a non-SGX-aware malloc library.</p></details> |  |

However, their deployment is accompanied by challenges in model privacy and auditability. Model providers want to ensure that (i) their proprietary models are not exposed to third parties; and (ii) be able to get attestations that their genuine models are operating on edge devices in accordance with the service agreement with the user. Existing measures to address these challenges have been hindered by issues such as high overheads and limited capability (processing/secure memory) on edge devices. In this work, we propose GuaranTEE, a framework to provide attestable private machine learning on the edge. GuaranTEE uses Confidential Computing Architecture (CCA), Arm's latest architectural extension that allows for the creation and deployment of dynamic Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) within which models can be executed. We evaluate CCA's feasibility to deploy ML models by developing, evaluating, and openly releasing a prototype. We also suggest improvements to CCA to facilitate its use in protecting the entire ML deployment pipeline on edge devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 4th Workshop on Machine Learning and Systems (EuroMLSys '24)</p></details> |

Such a protocol PoC is situated within a Zero-Trust Architecture (ZTA) and leverages confidential computing, continuous authentication, multi-party computation (MPC), and well-architected framework (WAF) principles to address the challenges of cybersecurity, privacy, and trust over IP (ToIP) protection. Employing a Kubernetes confidential cluster within an Enterprise-Scale Landing Zone (ESLZ), vSPACE integrates Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) for immutable and certifiable audit trails. The Infrastructure as Code (IaC) model ensures rapid deployment, consistent management, and adherence to security standards, making vSPACE a future-proof solution for digital voting systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trustworthy confidential virtual machines for the masses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15277v1)** | 2024-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential computing alleviates the concerns of distrustful customers by removing the cloud provider from their trusted computing base and resolves their disincentive to migrate their workloads to the cloud. This is facilitated by new hardware extensions, like AMD's SEV Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP), which can run a whole virtual machine with confidentiality and integrity protection against a potentially malicious hypervisor owned by an untrusted cloud provider. However, the assurance of such protection to either the service providers deploying sensitive workloads or the end-users passing sensitive data to services requires sending proof to the interested parties. Service providers can retrieve such proof by performing remote attestation while end-users have typically no means to acquire this proof or validate its correctness and therefore have to rely on the trustworthiness of the service providers. In this paper, we present Revelio, an approach that features two main contributions: i) it allows confidential virtual machine (VM)-based workloads to be designed and deployed in a way that disallows any tampering even by the service providers and ii) it empowers users to easily validate their integrity. In particular, we focus on web-facing workloads, protect them leveraging SEV-SNP, and enable end-users to remotely attest them seamlessly each time a new web session is established. To highlight the benefits of Revelio, we discuss how a standalone stateful VM that hosts an open-source collaboration office suite can be secured and present a replicated protocol proxy that enables commodity users to securely access the Internet Computer, a decentralized blockchain infrastructure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy-Enhancing Collaborative Information Sharing through Federated Learning -- A Case of the Insurance Industry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14983v1)** | 2024-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The report demonstrates the benefits (in terms of improved claims loss modeling) of harnessing the value of Federated Learning (FL) to learn a single model across multiple insurance industry datasets without requiring the datasets themselves to be shared from one company to another. The application of FL addresses two of the most pressing concerns: limited data volume and data variety, which are caused by privacy concerns, the rarity of claim events, the lack of informative rating factors, etc.. During each round of FL, collaborators compute improvements on the model using their local private data, and these insights are combined to update a global model. Such aggregation of insights allows for an increase to the effectiveness in forecasting claims losses compared to models individually trained at each collaborator. Critically, this approach enables machine learning collaboration without the need for raw data to leave the compute infrastructure of each respective data owner. Additionally, the open-source framework, OpenFL, that is used in our experiments is designed so that it can be run using confidential computing as well as with additional algorithmic protections against leakage of information via the shared model updates. In such a way, FL is implemented as a privacy-enhancing collaborative learning technique that addresses the challenges posed by the sensitivity and privacy of data in traditional machine learning solutions. This paper's application of FL can also be expanded to other areas including fraud detection, catastrophe modeling, etc., that have a similar need to incorporate data privacy into machine learning collaborations. Our framework and empirical results provide a foundation for future collaborations among insurers, regulators, academic researchers, and InsurTech experts.</p></details> |  |

CCA enables the support of confidential virtual machines (cVMs) within a separate world called the Realm world, providing protection from the untrusted normal world. While CCA offers a promising future for confidential computing, the widespread availability of CCA hardware is not expected in the near future, according to ARM's roadmap. To address this gap, we present virtCCA, an architecture that facilitates virtualized CCA using TrustZone, a mature hardware feature available on existing ARM platforms. Notably, virtCCA can be implemented on platforms equipped with the Secure EL2 (S-EL2) extension available from ARMv8.4 onwards, as well as on earlier platforms that lack S-EL2 support. virtCCA is fully compatible with the CCA specifications at the API level. We have developed the entire CCA software and firmware stack on top of virtCCA, including the enhancements to the normal world's KVM to support cVMs, and the TrustZone Management Monitor (TMM) that enforces isolation among cVMs and provides cVM life-cycle management. We have implemented virtCCA on real ARM servers, with and without S-EL2 support. Our evaluation, conducted on micro-benchmarks and macro-benchmarks, demonstrates that the overhead of running cVMs is acceptable compared to running normal-world VMs. Specifically, in a set of real-world workloads, the overhead of virtCCA-SEL2 is less than 29.5% for I/O intensive workloads, while virtCCA-EL3 outperforms the baseline in most cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[HasTEE+ : Confidential Cloud Computing and Analytics with Haskell](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08901v1)** | 2024-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential computing is a security paradigm that enables the protection of confidential code and data in a co-tenanted cloud deployment using specialized hardware isolation units called Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). By integrating TEEs with a Remote Attestation protocol, confidential computing allows a third party to establish the integrity of an \textit{enclave} hosted within an untrusted cloud. However, TEE solutions, such as Intel SGX and ARM TrustZone, offer low-level C/C++-based toolchains that are susceptible to inherent memory safety vulnerabilities and lack language constructs to monitor explicit and implicit information-flow leaks. Moreover, the toolchains involve complex multi-project hierarchies and the deployment of hand-written attestation protocols for verifying \textit{enclave} integrity. We address the above with HasTEE+, a domain-specific language (DSL) embedded in Haskell that enables programming TEEs in a high-level language with strong type-safety. HasTEE+ assists in multi-tier cloud application development by (1) introducing a \textit{tierless} programming model for expressing distributed client-server interactions as a single program, (2) integrating a general remote-attestation architecture that removes the necessity to write application-specific cross-cutting attestation code, and (3) employing a dynamic information flow control mechanism to prevent explicit as well as implicit data leaks. We demonstrate the practicality of HasTEE+ through a case study on confidential data analytics, presenting a data-sharing pattern applicable to mutually distrustful participants and providing overall performance metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>High-...</summary><p>High-quality pdf at https://abhiroop.github.io/pubs/HasTEE_ESORICS_Sarkar_Russo.pdf</p></details> |

Existing confidential computing systems cannot be certified for use in critical applications, like systems controlling critical infrastructure, hardware security modules, or aircraft, as they lack formal verification. This paper presents an approach to formally modeling and proving a security monitor. It introduces a canonical architecture for virtual machine (VM)-based confidential computing systems. It abstracts processor-specific components and identifies a minimal set of hardware primitives required by a trusted security monitor to enforce security guarantees. We demonstrate our methodology and proposed approach with an example from our Rust implementation of the security monitor for RISC-V.</p></details> |  |
| **[Making Your Program Oblivious: a Comparative Study for Side-channel-safe Confidential Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06442v1)** | 2023-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are gradually adopted by major cloud providers, offering a practical option of \emph{confidential computing} for users who don't fully trust public clouds. TEEs use CPU-enabled hardware features to eliminate direct breaches from compromised operating systems or hypervisors. However, recent studies have shown that side-channel attacks are still effective on TEEs. An appealing solution is to convert applications to be \emph{data oblivious} to deter many side-channel attacks. While a few research prototypes on TEEs have adopted specific data oblivious operations, the general conversion approaches have never been thoroughly compared against and tested on benchmark TEE applications. These limitations make it difficult for researchers and practitioners to choose and adopt a suitable data oblivious approach for their applications. To address these issues, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of several representative conversion approaches and implement benchmark TEE applications with them. We also perform an extensive empirical study to provide insights into their performance and ease of use.</p></details> |  |

Provided that the works accomplished in this emerging area are scattered across various research fields, this paper aims at surveying the fundamental concepts, and cutting-edge software and hardware solutions developed for confidential computing using trusted execution environments, homomorphic encryption, and secure enclaves. We underscore the significance of building trust in both hardware and software levels and delve into their applications particularly for machine learning (ML) applications. While substantial progress has been made, there are some barely-explored areas that need extra attention from the researchers and practitioners in the community to improve confidentiality aspects, develop more robust attestation mechanisms, and to address vulnerabilities of the existing trusted execution environments. Providing a comprehensive taxonomy of the confidential computing landscape, this survey enables researchers to advance this field to ultimately ensure the secure processing of users' sensitive data across a multitude of applications and computing tiers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Remote attestation of SEV-SNP confidential VMs using e-vTPMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16463v2)** | 2023-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trying to address the security challenges of a cloud-centric software deployment paradigm, silicon and cloud vendors are introducing confidential computing - an umbrella term aimed at providing hardware and software mechanisms for protecting cloud workloads from the cloud provider and its software stack. Today, Intel SGX, AMD SEV, Intel TDX, etc., provide a way to shield cloud applications from the cloud provider through encryption of the application's memory below the hardware boundary of the CPU, hence requiring trust only in the CPU vendor. Unfortunately, existing hardware mechanisms do not automatically enable the guarantee that a protected system was not tampered with during configuration and boot time. Such a guarantee relies on a hardware RoT, i.e., an integrity-protected location that can store measurements in a trustworthy manner, extend them, and authenticate the measurement logs to the user. In this work, we design and implement a virtual TPM that virtualizes the hardware RoT without requiring trust in the cloud provider. To ensure the security of a vTPM in a provider-controlled environment, we leverage unique isolation properties of the SEV-SNP hardware that allows us to execute secure services as part of the enclave environment protected from the cloud provider. We further develop a novel approach to vTPM state management where the vTPM state is not preserved across reboots. Specifically, we develop a stateless ephemeral vTPM that supports remote attestation without any persistent state on the host. This allows us to pair each confidential VM with a private instance of a vTPM completely isolated from the provider-controlled environment and other VMs. We built our prototype entirely on open-source components. Though our work is AMD-specific, a similar approach could be used to build remote attestation protocols on other trusted execution environments.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

Edge-cloud network suggests splitting and sharing data between the main cloud and the range of networks near the endpoint devices. The proposed solutions allow data in this two-level hierarchy to be protected via embedding traditional encryption at rest and in transit while leaving the remaining security issues, such as sensitive data and operations in use, in the scope of trusted execution environment. Hierarchical data for each network device are linked and identified through distinct paths between edge and main cloud using individual blockchain. Methods for data and cryptographic key splitting between the edge and the main cloud are based on strong authentication techniques ensuring the shared data confidentiality, integrity and availability.</p></details> |  |

One powerful solution for providing both is privacy-preserving computation, where functions are computed directly on encrypted data and control can be provided over how data is used. Garbled circuits (GCs) are a PPC technology that provide both confidential computing and control over how data is used. The challenge is that they incur significant performance overheads compared to plaintext. This paper proposes a novel garbled circuits accelerator and compiler, named HAAC, to mitigate performance overheads and make privacy-preserving computation more practical. HAAC is a hardware-software co-design. GCs are exemplars of co-design as programs are completely known at compile time, i.e., all dependence, memory accesses, and control flow are fixed. The design philosophy of HAAC is to keep hardware simple and efficient, maximizing area devoted to our proposed custom execution units and other circuits essential for high performance (e.g., on-chip storage). The compiler can leverage its program understanding to realize hardware's performance potential by generating effective instruction schedules, data layouts, and orchestrating off-chip events. In taking this approach we can achieve ASIC performance/efficiency without sacrificing generality. Insights of our approach include how co-design enables expressing arbitrary GCs programs as streams, which simplifies hardware and enables complete memory-compute decoupling, and the development of a scratchpad that captures data reuse by tracking program execution, eliminating the need for costly hardware managed caches and tagging logic. We evaluate HAAC with VIP-Bench and achieve an average speedup of 589$\times$ with DDR4 (2,627$\times$ with HBM2) in 4.3mm$^2$ of area.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 50th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)</p></details> |

The questions of how these systems can be built in a trustworthy manner and how their security properties can be understood are given fresh impetus by recent hardware developments, allowing a fuller, more general, exploration of the possibilities than has previously been seen in the literature. Drawing on and consolidating the disparate strains of research, technologies and methods employed throughout the adaptation of confidential computing, we present a novel, dedicated Confidential Remote Computing (CRC) model. CRC proposes a compact solution for next-generation applications to be built on strong hardware-based security primitives, control of secure software products' trusted computing base, and a way to make correct use of proofs and evidence reports generated by the attestation mechanisms. The CRC model illustrates the trade-offs between decentralisation, task size and transparency overhead. We conclude the paper with six lessons learned from our approach, and suggest two future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

This model is well established in large scale commercial deployment, but the downside is that all platform components and operators are in the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) of the tenant. This aspect is ill-suited for privacy-oriented workloads that aim to minimize the TCB footprint. Confidential computing presents a good stepping-stone towards providing a quantifiable TCB for computing. Confidential computing [1] requires the use of a HW-attested Trusted Execution Environments for data-in-use protection. The RISC-V architecture presents a strong foundation for meeting the requirements for Confidential Computing and other security paradigms in a clean slate manner. This paper describes a reference architecture and discusses ISA, non-ISA and system-on-chip (SoC) requirements for confidential computing on RISC-V Platforms. It discusses proposed ISA and non-ISA Extension for Confidential Virtual Machine for RISC-V platforms, referred to as CoVE.</p></details> |  |

| **[Intel TDX Demystified: A Top-Down Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15540v1)** | 2023-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intel Trust Domain Extensions (TDX) is a new architectural extension in the 4th Generation Intel Xeon Scalable Processor that supports confidential computing. TDX allows the deployment of virtual machines in the Secure-Arbitration Mode (SEAM) with encrypted CPU state and memory, integrity protection, and remote attestation. TDX aims to enforce hardware-assisted isolation for virtual machines and minimize the attack surface exposed to host platforms, which are considered to be untrustworthy or adversarial in the confidential computing's new threat model. TDX can be leveraged by regulated industries or sensitive data holders to outsource their computations and data with end-to-end protection in public cloud infrastructure. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of TDX to potential adopters, domain experts, and security researchers looking to leverage the technology for their own purposes. We adopt a top-down approach, starting with high-level security principles and moving to low-level technical details of TDX. Our analysis is based on publicly available documentation and source code, offering insights from security researchers outside of Intel.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI-Driven Confidential Computing across Edge-to-Cloud Continuum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00928v1)** | 2023-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the meteoric growth of technology, individuals and organizations are widely adopting cloud services to mitigate the burdens of maintenance. Despite its scalability and ease of use, many users who own sensitive data refrain from fully utilizing cloud services due to confidentiality concerns. Maintaining data confidentiality for data at rest and in transit has been widely explored but data remains vulnerable in the cloud while it is in use. This vulnerability is further elevated once the scope of computing spans across the edge-to-cloud continuum. Accordingly, the goal of this dissertation is to enable data confidentiality by adopting confidential computing across the continuum. Towards this goal, one approach we explore is to separate the intelligence aspect of data processing from the pattern-matching aspect. We present our approach to make confidential data clustering on the cloud, and then develop confidential search service across edge-to-cloud for unstructured text data. Our proposed clustering solution named ClusPr, performs topic-based clustering for static and dynamic datasets that improves cluster coherency up to 30%-to-60% when compared with other encryption-based clustering techniques. Our trusted enterprise search service named SAED, provides context-aware and personalized semantic search over confidential data across the continuum. We realized that enabling confidential computing across edge-to-cloud requires major contribution from the edge tiers particularly to run multiple Deep Learning (DL) services concurrently. This raises memory contention on the edge tier. To resolve this, we develop Edge-MultiAI framework to manage Neural Network (NN) models of DL applications such that it can meet the latency constraints of the DL applications without compromising inference accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD D...</summary><p>PhD Dissertation advised by Dr. Mohsen Amini Salehi</p></details> |

Researchers have studied its viability, performance, and usability. However, HPC in the cloud has a unique feature -- users have to export data and computation to somewhat untrusted cloud platforms. Users will either fully trust cloud providers to protect from all kinds of attacks or keep sensitive assets in-house instead. With the recent deployment of the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) in the cloud, confidential computing for HPC in the cloud is becoming practical for addressing users' privacy concerns. This paper discusses the threat models, unique challenges, possible solutions, and significant gaps, focusing on TEE-based confidential HPC computing. We hope this discussion will improve the understanding of this new topic for HPC in the cloud and promote new research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in IEEE Internet Computing</p></details> |
| **[Empowering Data Centers for Next Generation Trusted Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00306v1)** | 2022-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern data centers have grown beyond CPU nodes to provide domain-specific accelerators such as GPUs and FPGAs to their customers. From a security standpoint, cloud customers want to protect their data. They are willing to pay additional costs for trusted execution environments such as enclaves provided by Intel SGX and AMD SEV. Unfortunately, the customers have to make a critical choice -- either use domain-specific accelerators for speed or use CPU-based confidential computing solutions. To bridge this gap, we aim to enable data-center scale confidential computing that expands across CPUs and accelerators. We argue that having wide-scale TEE-support for accelerators presents a technically easier solution, but is far away from being a reality. Instead, our hybrid design provides enclaved execution guarantees for computation distributed over multiple CPU nodes and devices with/without TEE support. Our solution scales gracefully in two dimensions -- it can handle a large number of heterogeneous nodes and it can accommodate TEE-enabled devices as and when they are available in the future. We observe marginal overheads of $0.42$--$8\%$ on real-world AI data center workloads that are independent of the number of nodes in the data center. We add custom TEE support to two accelerators (AI and storage) and integrate it into our solution, thus demonstrating that it can cater to future TEE devices.</p></details> | 23 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Partially Trusting the Service Mesh Control Plane](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12610v1)** | 2022-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero Trust is a novel cybersecurity model that focuses on continually evaluating trust to prevent the initiation and horizontal spreading of attacks. A cloud-native Service Mesh is an example of Zero Trust Architecture that can filter out external threats. However, the Service Mesh does not shield the Application Owner from internal threats, such as a rogue administrator of the cluster where their application is deployed. In this work, we are enhancing the Service Mesh to allow the definition and reinforcement of a Verifiable Configuration that is defined and signed off by the Application Owner. Backed by automated digital signing solutions and confidential computing technologies, the Verifiable Configuration allows changing the trust model of the Service Mesh, from the data plane fully trusting the control plane to partially trusting it. This lets the application benefit from all the functions provided by the Service Mesh (resource discovery, traffic management, mutual authentication, access control, observability), while ensuring that the Cluster Administrator cannot change the state of the application in a way that was not intended by the Application Owner.</p></details> |  |
| **[CTR: Checkpoint, Transfer, and Restore for Secure Enclaves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15359v1)** | 2022-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are becoming increasingly prevalent in cloud computing, forming the basis for confidential computing. However, the security goals of TEEs sometimes conflict with existing cloud functionality, such as VM or process migration, because TEE memory cannot be read by the hypervisor, OS, or other software on the platform. Whilst some newer TEE architectures support migration of entire protected VMs, there is currently no practical solution for migrating individual processes containing in-process TEEs. The inability to migrate such processes leads to operational inefficiencies or even data loss if the host platform must be urgently restarted. We present CTR, a software-only design to retrofit migration functionality into existing TEE architectures, whilst maintaining their expected security guarantees. Our design allows TEEs to be interrupted and migrated at arbitrary points in their execution, thus maintaining compatibility with existing VM and process migration techniques. By cooperatively involving the TEE in the migration process, our design also allows application developers to specify stateful migration-related policies, such as limiting the number of times a particular TEE may be migrated. Our prototype implementation for Intel SGX demonstrates that migration latency increases linearly with the size of the TEE memory and is dominated by TEE system operations.</p></details> |  |

ITX enables the execution of AI workloads with strong confidentiality and integrity guarantees at low performance overheads. ITX isolates workloads from untrusted hosts, and ensures their data and models remain encrypted at all times except within the IPU. ITX includes a hardware root-of-trust that provides attestation capabilities and orchestrates trusted execution, and on-chip programmable cryptographic engines for authenticated encryption of code and data at PCIe bandwidth. We also present software for ITX in the form of compiler and runtime extensions that support multi-party training without requiring a CPU-based TEE. Experimental support for ITX is included in Graphcore's GC200 IPU taped out at TSMC's 7nm technology node. Its evaluation on a development board using standard DNN training workloads suggests that ITX adds less than 5% performance overhead, and delivers up to 17x better performance compared to CPU-based confidential computing systems relying on AMD SEV-SNP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trusted Container Extensions for Container-based Confidential Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05747v1)** | 2022-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud computing has emerged as a corner stone of today's computing landscape. More and more customers who outsource their infrastructure benefit from the manageability, scalability and cost saving that come with cloud computing. Those benefits get amplified by the trend towards microservices. Instead of renting and maintaining full VMs, customers increasingly leverage container technologies, which come with a much more lightweight resource footprint while also removing the need to emulate complete systems and their devices. However, privacy concerns hamper many customers from moving to the cloud and leveraging its benefits. Furthermore, regulatory requirements prevent the adaption of cloud computing in many industries, such as health care or finance. Standard software isolation mechanisms have been proven to be insufficient if the host system is not fully trusted, e.g., when the cloud infrastructure gets compromised by malicious third-party actors. Consequently, confidential computing is gaining increasing relevance in the cloud computing field. We present Trusted Container Extensions (TCX), a novel container security architecture, which combines the manageability and agility of standard containers with the strong protection guarantees of hardware-enforced Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to enable confidential computing for container workloads. TCX provides significant performance advantages compared to existing approaches while protecting container workloads and the data processed by them. Our implementation, based on AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV), ensures integrity and confidentiality of data and services during deployment, and allows secure interaction between protected containers as well as to external entities. Our evaluation shows that our implementation induces a low performance overhead of 5.77% on the standard SPEC2017 benchmark suite.</p></details> |  |
| **[Private delegated computations using strong isolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03322v1)** | 2022-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sensitive computations are now routinely delegated to third-parties. In response, Confidential Computing technologies are being introduced to microprocessors, offering a protected processing environment, which we generically call an isolate, providing confidentiality and integrity guarantees to code and data hosted within -- even in the face of a privileged attacker. Isolates, with an attestation protocol, permit remote third-parties to establish a trusted "beachhead" containing known code and data on an otherwise untrusted machine. Yet, the rise of these technologies introduces many new problems, including: how to ease provisioning of computations safely into isolates; how to develop distributed systems spanning multiple classes of isolate; and what to do about the billions of "legacy" devices without support for Confidential Computing? Tackling the problems above, we introduce Veracruz, a framework that eases the design and implementation of complex privacy-preserving, collaborative, delegated computations among a group of mutually mistrusting principals. Veracruz supports multiple isolation technologies and provides a common programming model and attestation protocol across all of them, smoothing deployment of delegated computations over supported technologies. We demonstrate Veracruz in operation, on private in-cloud object detection on encrypted video streaming from a video camera. In addition to supporting hardware-backed isolates -- like AWS Nitro Enclaves and Arm Confidential Computing Architecture Realms -- Veracruz also provides pragmatic "software isolates" on Armv8-A devices without hardware Confidential Computing capability, using the high-assurance seL4 microkernel and our IceCap framework.</p></details> |  |

This paper first demystifies SEV's improper use of address space identifier (ASID) for controlling accesses of a VM to encrypted memory pages, cache lines, and TLB entries. We then present the CROSSLINE attacks, a novel class of attacks against SEV that allow the adversary to launch an attacker VM and change its ASID to that of the victim VM to impersonate the victim. We present two variants of CROSSLINE attacks: CROSSLINE V1 decrypts victim's page tables or memory blocks following the format of a page table entry; CROSSLINE V2 constructs encryption and decryption oracles by executing instructions of the victim VM. We have successfully performed CROSSLINE attacks on SEV and SEV-ES processors.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, security</p></details> |

However, they introduce a notable performance overhead, especially when it comes to transitions in and out of the enclave context. Such overhead makes the use of enclaves impractical for running IO-intensive applications, such as network packet processing or biological sequence analysis. We build on earlier approaches to improve the IO performance of work-loads in Intel SGX enclaves and propose the SGX-Bundler library, which helps reduce the cost of both individual single enclave transitions well as of the total number of enclave transitions in trusted applications running in Intel SGX enclaves. We describe the implementation of the SGX-Bundler library, evaluate its performance and demonstrate its practicality using the case study of Open vSwitch, a widely used software switch implementation.</p></details> |  |

Computer architectures are evolving to accommodate the computing of large data better. Protecting the computation of sensitive data is also an imperative yet challenging objective; processor-supported secure enclaves serve as the key element in confidential computing in the cloud. However, side-channel attacks are threatening their security boundaries. The current processor architectures consume a considerable portion of its cycles in moving data. Near data computation is a promising approach that minimizes redundant data movement by placing computation inside storage. In this paper, we present a novel design for Processing-In-Memory (PIM) as a data-intensive workload accelerator for confidential computing. Based on our observation that moving computation closer to memory can achieve efficiency of computation and confidentiality of the processed information simultaneously, we study the advantages of confidential computing \emph{inside} memory. We then explain our security model and programming model developed for PIM-based computation offloading. We construct our findings into a software-hardware co-design, which we call PIM-Enclave. Our design illustrates the advantages of PIM-based confidential computing acceleration. Our evaluation shows PIM-Enclave can provide a side-channel resistant secure computation offloading and run data-intensive applications with negligible performance overhead compared to baseline PIM model.</p></details> |  |
| **[VIA: Analyzing Device Interfaces of Protected Virtual Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10660v1)** | 2021-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Both AMD and Intel have presented technologies for confidential computing in cloud environments. The proposed solutions - AMD SEV (-ES, -SNP) and Intel TDX - protect Virtual Machines (VMs) against attacks from higher privileged layers through memory encryption and integrity protection. This model of computation draws a new trust boundary between virtual devices and the VM, which in so far lacks thorough examination. In this paper, we therefore present an analysis of the virtual device interface and discuss several attack vectors against a protected VM. Further, we develop and evaluate VIA, an automated analysis tool to detect cases of improper sanitization of input recieved via the virtual device interface. VIA improves upon existing approaches for the automated analysis of device interfaces in the following aspects: (i) support for virtualization relevant buses, (ii) efficient Direct Memory Access (DMA) support and (iii) performance. VIA builds upon the Linux Kernel Library and clang's libfuzzer to fuzz the communication between the driver and the device via MMIO, PIO, and DMA. An evaluation of VIA shows that it performs 570 executions per second on average and improves performance compared to existing approaches by an average factor of 2706. Using VIA, we analyzed 22 drivers in Linux 5.10.0-rc6, thereby uncovering 50 bugs and initiating multiple patches to the virtual device driver interface of Linux. To prove our findings criticality under the threat model of AMD SEV and Intel TDX, we showcase three exemplary attacks based on the bugs found. The attacks enable a malicious hypervisor to corrupt the memory and gain code execution in protected VMs with SEV-ES and are theoretically applicable to SEV-SNP and TDX.</p></details> |  |
| **[Encrypted Data Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09821v1)** | 2021-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a comprehensive architecture for confidential computing, which we show to be general purpose and quite efficient. It executes the application as is, without any added burden or discipline requirements from the application developers. Furthermore, it does not require the trust of system software at the computing server and does not impose any added burden on the communication subsystem. The proposed Encrypted Data Processing (EDAP) architecture accomplishes confidentiality, authenticity, and freshness of the key-based cryptographic data protection by adopting data encryption with a multi-level key protection scheme. It guarantees that the user data is visible only in non-privileged mode to a designated program trusted by the data owner on a designated hardware, thus protecting the data from an untrusted hardware, hypervisor, OS, or other users' applications. The cryptographic keys and protocols used for achieving these confidential computing requirements are described in a use case example. Encrypting and decrypting data in an EDAP-enabled processor can lead to performance degradation as it adds cycle time to the overall execution. However, our simulation result shows that the slowdown is only 6% on average across a collection of commercial workloads when the data encryption engine is placed between the L1 and L2 cache. We demonstrate that the EDAP architecture is valuable and practicable in the modern cloud environment for confidential computing. EDAP delivers a zero trust model of computing where the user software does not trust system software and vice versa.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 12 figures, manuscript submitted to ACM Transactions on Privacy and Security</p></details> |

Hard to Trust](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01923v1)** | 2021-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As an emerging technique for confidential computing, trusted execution environment (TEE) receives a lot of attention. To better develop, deploy, and run secure applications on a TEE platform such as Intel's SGX, both academic and industrial teams have devoted much effort to developing reliable and convenient TEE containers. In this paper, we studied the isolation strategies of 15 existing TEE containers to protect secure applications from potentially malicious operating systems (OS) or untrusted applications, using a semi-automatic approach combining a feedback-guided analyzer with manual code review. Our analysis reveals the isolation protection each of these TEE containers enforces, and their security weaknesses. We observe that none of the existing TEE containers can fulfill the goal they set, due to various pitfalls in their design and implementation.

The monopolization of cloud computing resembles a feudalistic system, causing a loss of privacy and data ownership. Cloud Computing and the Internet in general face widely recognized challenges, such as (1) the centralization of trust in auxiliary systems (e.g., centralized cloud providers), (2) the seamless and permissionless interoperability of fragmented ecosystems and (2) the effectiveness, verifiability, and confidentiality of the computation. Acurast is a decentralized serverless cloud that addresses all these shortcomings, following the call for a global-scale cloud founded on the principles of the open-source movement. In Acurast, a purpose-built orchestrator, a reputation engine, and an attestation service are enshrined in the consensus layer. Developers can off-load their computations and verify executions cryptographically. Furthermore, Acurast offers a modular execution layer, taking advantage of secure hardware and trusted execution environments, removing the trust required in third parties, and reducing them to cryptographic hardness assumptions. With this modular architecture, Acurast serves as a decentralized and serverless cloud, allowing confidential and verifiable compute backed by the hardware of security and performance mobile devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>v. 0....</summary><p>v. 0.3., Jan 8th 2026, White Paper</p></details> |
| **[Melding the Serverless Control Plane with the Conventional Cluster Manager for Speed and Resource Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24551v4)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless platforms face a trade-off: conventional cluster managers like Kubernetes offer compatibility for co-locating Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) and Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) components of serverless applications, at the cost of high cold-start latency, whereas specialized FaaS-only systems like Dirigent achieve low latency by sacrificing compatibility, preventing integrated management and optimization. Our analysis reveals that FaaS traffic is bimodal: predictable, sustainable traffic consumes >98% of cluster resources, whereas sporadic, excessive bursts stress the control plane's scaling latency, not its throughput. With these insights, we design PulseNet, a serverless architecture that uses a dual-track control plane tailored to both traffic types. PulseNet's standard track manages sustainable traffic with long-lived, full-featured Regular Instances under a conventional cluster manager, preserving compatibility for the majority of the workload. To handle excessive traffic, an expedited track bypasses the slow manager to rapidly create short-lived, disposable Emergency Instances, minimizing cold-start latency and resource waste from idle instances. This hybrid approach achieves 35% better performance than Dirigent, a FaaS-only system, on a production workload at the same cost and outperforms other Kubernetes-compatible systems by 1.5-3.5x, reducing the cost by up to 70%.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, MapReduce, which is a popular big data processing model in the industry, has been widely applied in various fields. Inspired by the serverless framework of Function as a Service and the high concurrency and robustness of MapReduce programming model, this paper focus on combining them to reduce the time span and increase the efficiency when executing the word frequency counting task. In this case, the paper use a MapReduce programming model based on a serverless computing platform to figure out the most optimized number of Map functions and Reduce functions for a particular task. For the same amount of workload, extensive experiments show both execution time reduces and the overall efficiency of the program improves at different rates as the number of map functions and reduce functions increases. This paper suppose the discovery of the most optimized number of map and reduce functions can help cooperations and programmers figure out the most optimized solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, International Conference on Engineering Management, Information Technology and Intelligence (EMITI 2024)</p></details> |

However, efficiently deploying these systems on serverless GPU platforms presents significant resource allocation challenges due to heterogeneous agent workloads, varying computational demands, and the need for cost-effective scaling. This paper presents an adaptive GPU resource allocation framework that achieves 85% latency reduction compared to round-robin scheduling while maintaining comparable throughput to static allocation, using an O(N) complexity algorithm for real-time adaptation. Our approach dynamically allocates GPU resources based on workload characteristics, agent priorities, and minimum resource requirements, enabling efficient utilization while maintaining quality of service. The framework addresses three key challenges: (1) heterogeneous computational demands across lightweight coordinators and heavyweight specialists, (2) dynamic workload fluctuations requiring millisecond-scale reallocation, and (3) capacity constraints in serverless environments. Through comprehensive simulations modeling realistic multi-agent workflows with four heterogeneous agents, we demonstrate that adaptive allocation outperforms static equal and round-robin strategies across latency, cost, and GPU utilization metrics. The framework provides a practical solution for deploying cost-efficient multi-agent AI systems on serverless GPU infrastructure.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |

We present EdgeJury, a lightweight ensemble framework that improves truthfulness and robustness using only small instruction-tuned language models (3B-8B) suitable for serverless edge inference. EdgeJury orchestrates four stages: (1) parallel role-specialized generation, (2) anonymized cross-review with structured critiques and rankings, (3) chairman synthesis that integrates the strongest content while addressing flagged issues, and (4) claim-level consistency labeling based on inter-model agreement. On TruthfulQA (MC1), EdgeJury achieves 76.2% accuracy (95% CI: 72.8-79.6%), a +21.4% relative improvement over a single 8B baseline (62.8%), and outperforms standard baselines including self-consistency and majority voting under transparent compute accounting (total tokens and platform cost reported). On a 200-question adversarial EdgeCases set, EdgeJury yields +48.2% relative gains (95% CI: 44.0-52.4%). Manual analysis on 100 incorrect answers shows an approximately 55% reduction in factual hallucination errors versus the single-model baseline. Deployed on Cloudflare Workers AI, EdgeJury achieves 8.4 s median end-to-end latency, demonstrating that coordinated small-model ensembles can improve truthfulness on misconception-heavy QA benchmarks without external retrieval or proprietary large-model APIs.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages,3 Figures, Submitting to IEEE Access</p></details> |

However, serving multiple fine-tuned LLMs via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in serverless environments faces critical challenges: reactive adapter loading causes significant cold start latency, and frequent adapter swapping leads to severe GPU memory fragmentation. In this paper, we present Predictive-LoRA (P-LoRA), a proactive and fragmentation-aware serverless inference system for LoRA-based LLMs. P-LoRA introduces two key innovations: (1) a lightweight LSTM-based traffic predictor that forecasts adapter demand and proactively prefetches hot adapters from host memory to GPU, reducing cold start latency by up to 68%; and (2) a page-based adapter memory management mechanism inspired by operating system virtual memory, which keeps GPU memory utilization above 87% even under heterogeneous adapter ranks. We evaluate P-LoRA using production-like workloads derived from the Azure Functions trace. Experimental results demonstrate that P-LoRA achieves 1.52x higher throughput than S-LoRA while reducing the average Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) by 35% under high concurrency scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Remoe: Towards Efficient and Low-Cost MoE Inference in Serverless Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18674v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a dominant architecture in large language models (LLMs) due to its ability to scale model capacity via sparse expert activation. Meanwhile, serverless computing, with its elasticity and pay-per-use billing, is well-suited for deploying MoEs with bursty workloads. However, the large number of experts in MoE models incurs high inference costs due to memory-intensive parameter caching. These costs are difficult to mitigate via simple model partitioning due to input-dependent expert activation. To address these issues, we propose Remoe, a heterogeneous MoE inference system tailored for serverless computing. Remoe assigns non-expert modules to GPUs and expert modules to CPUs, and further offloads infrequently activated experts to separate serverless functions to reduce memory overhead and enable parallel execution. We incorporate three key techniques: (1) a Similar Prompts Searching (SPS) algorithm to predict expert activation patterns based on semantic similarity of inputs; (2) a Main Model Pre-allocation (MMP) algorithm to ensure service-level objectives (SLOs) via worst-case memory estimation; and (3) a joint memory and replica optimization framework leveraging Lagrangian duality and the Longest Processing Time (LPT) algorithm. We implement Remoe on Kubernetes and evaluate it across multiple LLM benchmarks. Experimental results show that Remoe reduces inference cost by up to 57% and cold start latency by 47% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, serverless cloud users remain vulnerable to various types of attacks, including micro-architectural side-channel attacks. These attacks typically rely on the physical co-location of victim and attacker instances, and attackers need to exploit cloud schedulers to achieve co-location with victims. Therefore, it is crucial to study vulnerabilities in serverless cloud schedulers and assess the security of different serverless scheduling algorithms. This study addresses the gap in understanding and constructing co-location attacks in serverless clouds. We present a comprehensive methodology to uncover exploitable features in serverless scheduling algorithms and to devise strategies for constructing co-location attacks via normal user interfaces. In our experiments, we successfully reveal exploitable vulnerabilities and achieve instance co-location on prevalent open-source infrastructures and Microsoft Azure Functions. We also present a mitigation strategy, the Double-Dip scheduler, to defend against co-location attacks in serverless clouds. Our work highlights critical areas for security enhancements in current cloud schedulers, offering insights to fortify serverless computing environments against potential co-location attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>In th...</summary><p>In the proceedings of Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS) Symposium 2026</p></details> |

Unlike prior work that treats mitigation as a black-box optimization, we study cold starts as a developer-visible design problem. From 81 adjudicated issue reports across open-source serverless systems, we derive taxonomies of initialization anti-patterns, remediation strategies, and diagnostic challenges spanning design, packaging, and runtime layers. Building on these insights, we introduce SCABENCH, a reproducible benchmark, and INITSCOPE, a lightweight analysis framework linking what code is loaded with what is executed. On SCABENCH, INITSCOPE improved localization accuracy by up to 40% and reduced diagnostic effort by 64% compared with prior tools, while a developer study showed higher task accuracy and faster diagnosis. Together, these results advance evidence-driven, performance-aware practices for cold-start mitigation in serverless design.

While existing serverless solutions follow exclusive GPU allocation, we take a step back to explore modern platforms and find that: Emerging CPU architectures with built-in accelerators are capable of serving LLMs but remain underutilized, and both CPUs and GPUs can accommodate multiple LLMs simultaneously. We propose SLINFER, a resource-efficient serverless inference scheme tailored for small- to mid-sized LLMs that enables elastic and on-demand sharing across heterogeneous hardware. SLINFER tackles three fundamental challenges: (1) precise, fine-grained compute resource allocation at token-level to handle fluctuating computational demands; (2) a coordinated and forward-looking memory scaling mechanism to detect out-of-memory hazards and reduce operational overhead; and (3) a dual approach that consolidates fragmented instances through proactive preemption and reactive bin-packing. Experimental results on 4 32-core CPUs and 4 A100 GPUs show that SLINFER improves serving capacity by 47% - 62% through sharing, while further leveraging CPUs boosts this to 86% - 154%.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at HPCA 2026</p></details> |

While compute resources assigned to VM-sandboxed functions can be seamlessly adjusted on the fly, memory elasticity remains challenging. Hot(un)plugging memory resources suffers from long reclamation latencies and occupies valuable CPU resources. We identify the obliviousness of the OS memory manager to the hotplugged memory as the key issue hindering hot-unplug performance, and design Squeezy, a novel approach for fast and efficient VM memory hot(un)plug, targeting VM-sandboxed serverless functions. Our key insight is that by segregating hotplugged memory regions from regular VM memory, we are able to bound the lifetime of allocations within these regions thus enabling their fast and efficient reclamation. We implement Squeezy in Linux v6.6 as an extension to the OS memory manager. Our evaluation reveals that Squeezy is an order-of-magnitude faster than state-of-the-art, keeping tail latency bounded, when reclaiming VM memory, achieving sub-second reclamation of multiple GiBs of memory while serving realistic FaaS load.</p></details> |  |

To meet this challenge, the data engineering field has expanded significantly in recent years in both research and industry. Traditionally, data engineering, Machine Learning, and AI workloads have been run on large clusters within data center environments, requiring substantial investment in hardware and maintenance. With the rise of the public cloud, it is now possible to run large applications across nodes without owning or maintaining hardware. Serverless functions such as AWS Lambda provide horizontal scaling and precise billing without the hassle of managing traditional cloud infrastructure. However, when processing large datasets, users often rely on external storage options that are significantly slower than direct communication typical of HPC clusters. We introduce Cylon, a high-performance distributed data frame solution that has shown promising results for data processing using Python. We describe how we took inspiration from the FMI library and designed a serverless communicator to tackle communication and performance issues associated with serverless functions. With our design, we demonstrate that the performance of AWS Lambda falls below one percent of strong scaling experiments compared to serverful AWS (EC2) and HPCs based on implementing direct communication via NAT Traversal TCP Hole Punching.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, optimizing scheduling for serverless functions remains challenging due to their dynamic and event-driven nature. While data locality has been proven effective in traditional cluster computing systems through delay scheduling, its application in serverless platforms remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we systematically evaluate existing delay scheduling methods in serverless environments and identify three key observations: 1) delay scheduling benefits vary significantly based on function input characteristics; 2) serverless computing exhibits more complex locality patterns than cluster computing systems, encompassing both data locality and infrastructure locality; and 3) heterogeneous function execution times make rule-based delay thresholds ineffective. Based on these insights, we propose Metronome, a differentiated delay scheduling framework that employs predictive mechanisms to identify optimal locality-aware nodes for individual functions. Metronome leverages an online Random Forest Regression model to forecast function execution times across various nodes, enabling informed delay decisions while preventing SLA violations. Our implementation on OpenLambda shows that Metronome significantly outperforms baselines, achieving 64.88%-95.83% reduction in mean execution time for functions, while maintaining performance advantages under increased concurrency levels and ensuring SLA compliance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICSE 2026</p></details> |

However, cold-start latency, especially the model loading phase, has become a critical performance bottleneck, as it scales linearly with model size and severely limits the practical deployment of large-scale LLM services. This paper presents Tangram, a novel system that accelerates Serverless LLM loading through efficient GPU memory reuse. By leveraging the unused GPU memory to retain model parameters, Tangram significantly reduces model transfer time and cold-start latency. Its design includes three key components: unified GPU memory pool for tensor-level parameter sharing across models, on-demand KV cache allocation for dynamic memory management, and GPU-affinity-aware scheduling for maximizing resource utilization. These techniques collectively address the critical challenges of inefficient memory usage and the cold-start problem in Serverless LLM platforms. We have implemented a fully functional prototype, and experiments show that Tangram achieves up to 6.2 times faster loading and reduces Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) during cold-start by 23--55% over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

It enables developers to implement function-level tasks, i.e., serverless functions, without managing infrastructure. While reducing operational overhead, it poses challenges, especially for novice developers. Developing functions from scratch requires adapting to heterogeneous, platform-specific programming styles, making the process time-consuming and error-prone. Function reuse offers a promising solution to address these challenges. However, research on serverless computing lacks a dedicated approach for function recommendation. Existing techniques from traditional contexts remain insufficient due to the semantic gap between task descriptions and heterogeneous function implementations. Advances in large language models (LLMs), pre-trained on large-scale corpora, create opportunities to bridge this gap by aligning developer requirements with function semantics. This paper presents SlsReuse, the first LLM-powered framework for serverless function reuse. Specifically, SlsReuse first constructs a reusable function repository serving as a foundational knowledge base. Then, it learns unified semantic-enhanced representations of heterogeneous functions through effective prompt engineering with few-shot prompting, capturing implicit code intent, target platforms, programming languages, and cloud services. Finally, given a natural language task query, SlsReuse performs intent-aware discovery combined with a multi-level pruning strategy and similarity matching. We evaluate SlsReuse on a curated dataset of 110 task queries. Built on ChatGPT-4o, one of the most representative LLMs, SlsReuse achieves Recall@10 of 91.20%, exceeding the state-of-the-art baseline by 24.53 percentage points.</p></details> |  |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in this setting. However, traditional statically-provisioned GNN inference architectures fall short in meeting two crucial demands of intrusion detection: (1) maintaining consistently low detection latency, and (2) handling highly irregular and bursty workloads. To holistically address these challenges, we present GraphFaaS, a serverless architecture tailored for GNN-based intrusion detection. GraphFaaS leverages the elasticity and agility of serverless computing to dynamically scale the GNN inference pipeline. We parallelize and adapt GNN workflows to a serverless environment, ensuring that the system can respond in real time to fluctuating workloads. By decoupling compute resources from static provisioning, GraphFaaS delivers stable inference latency, which is critical for dependable intrusion detection and timely incident response in cybersecurity operations. Preliminary evaluation shows GraphFaaS reduces average detection latency by 85% and coefficient of variation (CV) by 64% compared to the baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ML For Systems workshop at Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

Despite these benefits, challenges such as startup latencies, static configurations, sub-optimal resource allocation and scheduling still exist due to coupled resource offering and workload-agnostic generic scheduling behaviour. These issues often lead to inconsistent function performance and unexpected operational costs for users and service providers. This paper introduces Saarthi, a novel, end-to-end serverless framework that intelligently manages the dynamic resource needs of function workloads, representing a significant step toward self-driving serverless platforms. Unlike platforms that rely on static resource configurations, Saarthi is input-aware, allowing it to intelligently anticipate resource requirements based on the characteristics of an incoming request payload. This input-driven approach reinforces function right-sizing and enables smart request orchestration across available function configurations. Saarthi further integrates a proactive fault-tolerant redundancy mechanism and employs a multi-objective Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model to maintain an optimal function quantity. This optimisation aims to maximise system throughput while simultaneously reducing overall operational costs. We validate the effectiveness of Saarthi by implementing it as a framework atop OpenFaaS. Our results demonstrate Saarthi's ability to achieve up to 1.45x better throughput, 1.84x reduced costs, while maintaining up to 98.3% service level targets with an overhead of up to 0.2 seconds as compared to the baseline OpenFaaS.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, 1 table, 2 algorithms</p></details> |

However, its performance and stability depend heavily on factors such as startup overhead, runtime execution model (e.g., Ahead-of-Time (AOT) and Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation), and resource variability across deployment contexts. This paper evaluates a Wasm-based serverless workflow executed consistently from the browser to edge and cloud instances. The setup uses wasm32-wasi modules: in the browser, execution occurs within a web worker, while on Edge and Cloud, an HTTP shim streams frames to the Wasm runtime. We measure cold- and warm-start latency, per-step delays, workflow makespan, throughput, and CPU/memory utilization to capture the end-to-end behavior across environments. Results show that AOT compilation and instance warming substantially reduce startup latency. For workflows with small payloads, the browser achieves competitive performance owing to fully in-memory data exchanges. In contrast, as payloads grow, the workflow transitions into a compute- and memory-intensive phase where AOT execution on edge and cloud nodes distinctly surpasses browser performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 Figures, 2 Tables, conference paper</p></details> |

As these workloads run in heterogeneous environments such as the Edge-Cloud-Space 3D Continuum, they often require intensive parallel computation, which GPUs can perform far more efficiently than CPUs. However, current platforms struggle to manage hardware acceleration effectively, as static user-device assignments fail to ensure SLO compliance under varying loads or placements, and one-time dynamic selections often lead to suboptimal or cost-inefficient configurations. To address these issues, we present Gaia, a GPU-as-a-service model and architecture that makes hardware acceleration a platform concern. Gaia combines (i) a lightweight Execution Mode Identifier that inspects function code at deploy time to emit one of four execution modes, and a Dynamic Function Runtime that continuously reevaluates user-defined SLOs to promote or demote between CPU- and GPU backends. Our evaluation shows that it seamlessly selects the best hardware acceleration for the workload, reducing end-to-end latency by up to 95%. These results indicate that Gaia enables SLO-aware, cost-efficient acceleration for serverless AI across heterogeneous environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>In IE...</summary><p>In IEEE ACM 12th International Conference on Big Data Computing, Applications and Technologies (BDCAT 25), 2025, Nantes, France</p></details> |

Alas, existing serverless data analytics works focus primarily on the serverless execution engine and assume the existence of a "good" query execution plan or rely on user guidance to construct such a plan. Meanwhile, even simple analytics queries on serverless have a huge space of possible plans, with vast differences in both performance and cost among plans. This paper introduces Odyssey, an end-to-end serverless-native data analytics pipeline that integrates a query planner, cost model and execution engine. Odyssey automatically generates and evaluates serverless query plans, utilizing state space pruning heuristics and a novel search algorithm to identify Pareto-optimal plans that balance cost and performance with low latency even for complex queries. Our evaluations demonstrate that Odyssey accurately predicts both monetary cost and latency, and consistently outperforms AWS Athena on cost and/or latency.</p></details> |  |

By design serverless functions are stateless, which means they typically leverage external remote services to store and exchange data. Transferring data over a network typically involves serialization and deserialization. These operations usually require multiple data copies and transitions between user and kernel space, resulting in overhead from context switching and memory allocation, contributing significantly to increased latency and resource consumption. To address these issues, we present Roadrunner, a sidecar shim that enables near-zero copy and serialization-free data transfer between WebAssembly-based serverless functions. Roadrunner reduces the multiple copies between user space and kernel space by mapping the function memory and moving the data along a dedicated virtual data hose, bypassing the costly processes of serialization and deserialization. This approach reduces data movement overhead and context switching, achieving near-native latency performance for WebAssembly-based serverless functions. Our experimental results demonstrate that Roadrunner significantly improves the inter-function communication latency from 44% up to 89%, reducing the serialization overhead in 97% of data transfer, and increasing throughput by 69 times compared to state-of-the-art WebAssembly-based serverless functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>26th ...</summary><p>26th International Middleware Conference (MIDDLEWARE 25)</p></details> |

In current FaaS platforms, both synchronous and asynchronous calls are executed immediately. In this paper, we present ProFaaStinate, which extends serverless platforms to enable delayed execution of asynchronous function calls. This allows platforms to execute calls at convenient times with higher resource availability or lower load. ProFaaStinate is able to optimize performance without requiring deep integration into the rest of the platform, or a complex systems model. In our evaluation, our prototype built on top of Nuclio can reduce request response latency and workflow duration while also preventing the system from being overloaded during load peaks. Using a document preparation use case, we show a 54% reduction in average request response latency. This reduction in resource usage benefits both platforms and users as cost savings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Proc. of 9th International Workshop on Serverless Computing (WoSC 23)</p></details> |
| **[GeoFF: Federated Serverless Workflows with Data Pre-Fetching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13594v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is a popular cloud computing model in which applications are implemented as work flows of multiple independent functions. While cloud providers usually offer composition services for such workflows, they do not support cross-platform workflows forcing developers to hardcode the composition logic. Furthermore, FaaS workflows tend to be slow due to cascading cold starts, inter-function latency, and data download latency on the critical path. In this paper, we propose GeoFF, a serverless choreography middleware that executes FaaS workflows across different public and private FaaS platforms, including ad-hoc workflow recomposition. Furthermore, GeoFF supports function pre-warming and data pre-fetching. This minimizes end-to-end workflow latency by taking cold starts and data download latency off the critical path. In experiments with our proof-of-concept prototype and a realistic application, we were able to reduce end-to-end latency by more than 50%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Serverless GPU Architecture for Enterprise HR Analytics: A Production-Scale BDaaS Implementation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19689v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial and government organizations increasingly depend on data-driven analytics for workforce, finance, and regulated decision processes, where timeliness, cost efficiency, and compliance are critical. Distributed frameworks such as Spark and Flink remain effective for massive-scale batch or streaming analytics but introduce coordination complexity and auditing overheads that misalign with moderate-scale, latency-sensitive inference. Meanwhile, cloud providers now offer serverless GPUs, and models such as TabNet enable interpretable tabular ML, motivating new deployment blueprints for regulated environments. In this paper, we present a production-oriented Big Data as a Service (BDaaS) blueprint that integrates a single-node serverless GPU runtime with TabNet. The design leverages GPU acceleration for throughput, serverless elasticity for cost reduction, and feature-mask interpretability for IL4/FIPS compliance. We conduct benchmarks on the HR, Adult, and BLS datasets, comparing our approach against Spark and CPU baselines. Our results show that GPU pipelines achieve up to 4.5x higher throughput, 98x lower latency, and 90% lower cost per 1K inferences compared to Spark baselines, while compliance mechanisms add only ~5.7 ms latency with p99 < 22 ms. Interpretability remains stable under peak load, ensuring reliable auditability. Taken together, these findings provide a compliance-aware benchmark, a reproducible Helm-packaged blueprint, and a decision framework that demonstrate the practicality of secure, interpretable, and cost-efficient serverless GPU analytics for regulated enterprise and government settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables.

Public serverless repositories have become key to accelerating the development of serverless applications. However, their growing popularity makes them attractive targets for adversaries. Despite this, the security posture of these repositories remains largely unexplored, exposing developers and organizations to potential risks. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive analysis of the security landscape of serverless components hosted in public repositories. We analyse 2,758 serverless components from five widely used public repositories popular among developers and enterprises, and 125,936 Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates across three widely used IaC frameworks. Our analysis reveals systemic vulnerabilities including outdated software packages, misuse of sensitive parameters, exploitable deployment configurations, susceptibility to typo-squatting attacks and opportunities to embed malicious behaviour within compressed serverless components. Finally, we provide practical recommendations to mitigate these threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ESORICS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Object as a Service: Simplifying Cloud-Native Development through Serverless Object Abstraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04898v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The function-as-a-service (FaaS) paradigm is envisioned as the next generation of cloud computing systems that mitigate the burden for cloud-native application developers by abstracting them from cloud resource management. However, it does not deal with the application data aspects. As such, developers have to intervene and undergo the burden of managing the application data, often via separate cloud storage services. To further streamline cloud-native application development, in this work, we propose a new paradigm, known as Object as a Service (OaaS) that encapsulates application data and functions into the cloud object abstraction. OaaS relieves developers from resource and data management burden while offering built-in optimization features. Inspired by OOP, OaaS incorporates access modifiers and inheritance into the serverless paradigm that: (a) prevents developers from compromising the system via accidentally accessing underlying data; and (b) enables software reuse in cloud-native application development. Furthermore, OaaS natively supports dataflow semantics. It enables developers to define function workflows while transparently handling data navigation, synchronization, and parallelism issues. To establish the OaaS paradigm, we develop a platform named Oparaca that offers state abstraction for structured and unstructured data with consistency and fault-tolerant guarantees. We evaluated Oparaca under real-world settings against state-of-the-art platforms with respect to the imposed overhead, scalability, and ease of use. The results demonstrate that the object abstraction provided by OaaS can streamline flexible and scalable cloud-native application development with an insignificant overhead on the underlying serverless system.</p></details> |  |

Current systems rely on static pipeline configurations that struggle to adapt to dynamic workload conditions, leading to substantial inefficiencies. We present FlexPipe, a novel system that dynamically reconfigures pipeline architectures during runtime to address these fundamental limitations. FlexPipe decomposes models into fine-grained stages and intelligently adjusts pipeline granularity based on real-time request pattern analysis, implementing three key innovations: fine-grained model partitioning with preserved computational graph constraints, inflight pipeline refactoring with consistent cache transitions, and topology-aware resource allocation that navigates GPU fragmentation. Comprehensive evaluation on an 82-GPU cluster demonstrates that FlexPipe achieves up to 8.5x better resource efficiency while maintaining 38.3% lower latency compared to state-of-the-art systems, reducing GPU reservation requirements from 75% to 30% of peak capacity.</p></details> | EuroSys 26 |
| **[Multi-Event Triggers for Serverless Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21199v3)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is an event-driven serverless cloud computing model in which small, stateless functions are invoked in response to events, such as HTTP requests, new database entries, or messages. Current FaaS platform assume that each function invocation corresponds to a single event. However, from an application perspective, it is desirable to invoke functions in response to a collection of events of different types or only with every n\textsuperscript{th} event. To implement this today, a function would need additional state management, e.g., in a database, and custom logic to determine whether its trigger condition is fulfilled and the actual application code should run. In such an implementation, most function invocations would be rendered essentially useless, leading to unnecessarily high resource usage, latency, and cost for applications. In this paper, we introduce multi-event triggers, through which complex conditions for function invocations can be specified. Specifically, we introduce abstractions for invoking functions based on a set of $n$ events and joins of multiple events of different types. This enables application developers to define intricate conditions for function invocations, workflow steps, and complex event processing. Our evaluation with a proof-of-concept prototype shows that this reduces event--invocation latency by 62.5\% in an incident detection use-case and that our system can handle more than 300,000 requests per second on limited hardware, which is sufficient load for implementation in large FaaS platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publishing at IC2E'25</p></details> |

Serv-Drishti simulates and visualises the journey of a request through a representative serverless platform, from the API Gateway and intelligent Request Dispatcher to dynamic Function Instances on resource-constrained Compute Nodes. Unlike simple simulators, Serv-Drishti provides a robust framework for comparative analysis. It features configurable platform parameters, multiple request routing and function placement strategies, and a comprehensive failure simulation module. This allows users to not only observe but also rigorously analyse system responses under various loads and fault conditions.

| **[Towards Energy-Efficient Serverless Computing with Hardware Isolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08180v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing provides just-in-time infrastructure provisioning with rapid elasticity and a finely-grained pricing model. As full control of resource allocation is in the hands of the cloud provider and applications only consume resources when they actually perform work, we believe that serverless computing is uniquely positioned to maximize energy efficiency. However, the focus of current serverless platforms is to run hundreds or thousands of serverless functions from different tenants on traditional server hardware, requiring expensive software isolation mechanisms and a high degree of overprovisioning, i.e., idle servers, to anticipate load spikes. With shared caches, high clock frequencies, and many-core architectures, servers today are optimized for large, singular workloads but not to run thousands of isolated functions. We propose rethinking the serverless hardware architecture to align it with the requirements of serverless software. Specifically, we propose using hardware isolation with individual processors per function instead of software isolation resulting in a serverless hardware stack that consumes energy only when an application actually performs work. In preliminary evaluation with real hardware and a typical serverless workload we find that this could reduce energy consumption overheads by 90.63% or an average 70.8MW.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Cosmic AI Inference using Cloud Serverless Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06249v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale astronomical image data processing and prediction are essential for astronomers, providing crucial insights into celestial objects, the universe's history, and its evolution. While modern deep learning models offer high predictive accuracy, they often demand substantial computational resources, making them resource-intensive and limiting accessibility. We introduce the Cloud-based Astronomy Inference (CAI) framework to address these challenges. This scalable solution integrates pre-trained foundation models with serverless cloud infrastructure through a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS). CAI enables efficient and scalable inference on astronomical images without extensive hardware. Using a foundation model for redshift prediction as a case study, our extensive experiments cover user devices, HPC (High-Performance Computing) servers, and Cloud. Using redshift prediction with the AstroMAE model demonstrated CAI's scalability and efficiency, achieving inference on a 12.6 GB dataset in only 28 seconds compared to 140.8 seconds on HPC GPUs and 1793 seconds on HPC CPUs. CAI also achieved significantly higher throughput, reaching 18.04 billion bits per second (bps), and maintained near-constant inference times as data sizes increased, all at minimal computational cost (under $5 per experiment). We also process large-scale data up to 1 TB to show CAI's effectiveness at scale. CAI thus provides a highly scalable, accessible, and cost-effective inference solution for the astronomy community.

In this serverless model, FaaS provides an event-driven, function-oriented computing service characterised by fine-grained, usage-based pricing that eliminates cost for idle resources. Platforms like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Cloud Run Functions require developers to configure their function(s) with minimum operational resources for its successful execution. This resource allocation influences both the operational expense and the performance quality of these functions. However, a noticeable lack of platform transparency forces developers to rely on expert knowledge or experience-based ad-hoc decisions to request desired function resources. This makes optimal resource configuration a non-trivial task while adhering to performance constraints. Furthermore, while commercial platforms often scale resources like CPU and network bandwidth proportional to memory, open-source frameworks permit independent configuration of function resources, introducing additional complexity for developers aiming to optimise their functions. These complexities have directed researchers to resolve developer challenges and advance towards an efficient server-less execution model. In this article, we identify different aspects of resource configuration techniques in FaaS settings and propose a taxonomy of factors that influence function design, configuration, run-time cost, and performance guarantees. We conduct an analysis of existing literature on resource configuration to present a comprehensive review of current studies on function configuration. We also identify existing research gaps and suggest future research directions to enhance function configuration and strengthen the capabilities of serverless computing environments to drive its broader adoption.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables, journal</p></details> |

However, the performance benefits versus trade-offs remain insufficiently understood. This paper presents Lumos, a performance model and benchmarking tool for characterizing serverless runtimes. Lumos identifies workload, system, and environment-level performance drivers in the Edge-Cloud Continuum. We benchmark state-of-the-art containers and the Wasm runtime in interpreted mode and with ahead-of-time compilation. Our performance characterization shows that AoT-compiled Wasm images are up to 30x smaller and decrease cold-start latency by up to 16% compared to containers, while interpreted Wasm suffers up to 55x higher warm latency and up to 10x I/O-serialization overhead.</p></details> |  |

However, compared to virtual machines and container hosting services, modern serverless offerings typically impose higher per-unit time and resource charges. Additionally, billing practices such as wall-clock time allocation-based billing, invocation fees, and usage rounding up can further increase costs. This work, for the first time, holistically demystifies these costs by conducting an in-depth, top-down characterization and analysis from user-facing billing models, through request serving architectures, and down to operating system scheduling on major public serverless platforms. We quantify, for the first time, how current billing practices inflate billable resources up to 4.35x beyond actual consumption. Also, our analysis reveals previously unreported cost drivers, such as operational patterns of serving architectures that create overheads, details of resource allocation during keep-alive periods, and OS scheduling granularity effects that directly impact both performance and billing. By tracing the sources of costs from billing models down to OS scheduling, we uncover the rationale behind today's expensive serverless billing model and practices and provide insights for designing performant and cost-effective serverless systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the Proceedings of the Twenty-First European Conference on Computer Systems (EuroSys '26)</p></details> |

Efforts to mitigate this impact typically focus on the infrastructure level such as powering data centers with renewable energy, or through the specific design of energy-efficient software. However, both strategies rely on stakeholder intervention, making their adoption in legacy and already-deployed systems unlikely. As a result, past architectural and implementation decisions continue to incur additional energy usage - a phenomenon we refer to as energy debt. Hence, in this paper, we investigate the potential of serverless computing platforms to automatically reduce energy debt by leveraging the unique access to function source code. Specifically, we explore whether large language models (LLMs) can translate serverless functions into more energy-efficient programming languages while preserving functional correctness. To this end, we design and implement ReFaaS and integrate it into the Fission serverless framework. We evaluate multiple LLMs on their ability to perform such code translations and analyze their impact on energy consumption. Our preliminary results indicate that translated functions can reduce invocation energy by up to 70%, achieving net energy savings after approximately 3,000 to 5,000 invocations, depending on the LLM used. Nonetheless, the approach faces several challenges: not all functions are suitable for translation, and for some, the amortization threshold is significantly higher or unreachable. Despite these limitations, we identify four key research challenges whose resolution could unlock long-term, automated mitigation of energy debt in serverless computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IC2E 2025</p></details> |

However, public cloud providers often struggle to provide performance guarantees for serverless LLM serving due to significant cold start latency caused by substantial model sizes and complex runtime dependencies. To address this problem, we present HydraServe, a serverless LLM serving system designed to minimize cold start latency in public clouds. HydraServe proactively distributes models across servers to quickly fetch them, and overlaps cold-start stages within workers to reduce startup latency. Additionally, HydraServe strategically places workers across GPUs to avoid network contention among cold-start instances. To minimize resource consumption during cold starts, HydraServe further introduces pipeline consolidation that can merge groups of workers into individual serving endpoints. Our comprehensive evaluations under diverse settings demonstrate that HydraServe reduces the cold start latency by 1.7$\times$-- 4.7$\times$ and improves service level objective attainment by 1.43$\times$--1.74$\times$ compared to baselines.</p></details> | Accepted by NSDI'26 |

Many systems and applications benefit from offloading computations and parallel tasks to dynamically allocated resources. However, the developers of C++ applications find it difficult to integrate functions due to complex deployment, lack of compatibility between client and cloud environments, and loosely typed input and output data. To enable single-source and efficient serverless acceleration in C++, we introduce Cppless, an end-to-end framework for implementing remote functions which handles the creation, deployment, and invocation of serverless functions. Cppless is built on top of LLVM and requires only two compiler extensions to automatically extract C++ function objects and deploy them to the cloud. We demonstrate that offloading parallel computations, such as from a C++ application to serverless workers, can provide up to 59x speedup with minimal cost increase while requiring only minor code modifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of paper accepted at the ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization (TACO) journal</p></details> |

Serverless computing has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these challenges by offering dynamic scalability and resource-efficient execution. Building upon our previous work, which introduced the Serverless Peer Integrated for Robust Training (SPIRT) architecture, this paper presents a comparative analysis of several serverless distributed ML architectures. We examine SPIRT alongside established architectures like ScatterReduce, AllReduce, and MLLess, focusing on key metrics such as training time efficiency, cost-effectiveness, communication overhead, and fault tolerance capabilities. Our findings reveal that SPIRT provides significant improvements in reducing training times and communication overhead through strategies such as parallel batch processing and in-database operations facilitated by RedisAI. However, traditional architectures exhibit scalability challenges and varying degrees of vulnerability to faults and adversarial attacks. The cost analysis underscores the long-term economic benefits of SPIRT despite its higher initial setup costs. This study not only highlights the strengths and limitations of current serverless ML architectures but also sets the stage for future research aimed at developing new models that combine the most effective features of existing systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[λScale: Enabling Fast Scaling for Serverless Large Language Model Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09922v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing has emerged as a compelling solution for cloud-based model inference. However, as modern large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in size, existing serverless platforms often face substantial model startup overhead. This poses a significant challenge in efficiently scaling model instances to accommodate dynamic, bursty workloads commonly observed in real-world inference services. In this paper, we introduce λScale, an efficient serverless inference system to achieve fast model scaling. The key idea behind λScale is to leverage high-speed RDMA networks between GPU nodes for fast model multicast, while enabling distributed inference execution during model transmission -- referred to as "execute-while-load". λScale proposes an efficient model scaling scheme, λPipe, which supports adaptive model multicast and dynamically constructs execution pipelines across receiving nodes for collaborative, distributed inference. Additionally, λScale supports efficient model management across GPU and host memory, allowing fast scaling for models across different storage tiers. Evaluation results show that λScale enables fast model scaling and effectively handles load spikes, achieving up to 5x tail-latency improvement and 31.3% cost reduction compared to state-of-the-art solutions on real-world LLM inference traces.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming Serverless Cold Starts Through OS Co-Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14292v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing promises fine-grained elasticity and operational simplicity, fueling widespread interest from both industry and academia. Yet this promise is undercut by the cold setart problem, where invoking a function after a period of inactivity triggers costly initialization before any work can begin. Even with today's high-speed storage, the prevailing view is that achieving sub-millisecond cold starts requires keeping state resident in memory. This paper challenges that assumption. Our analysis of existing snapshot/restore mechanisms show that OS-level limitations, not storage speed, are the real barrier to ultra-fast restores from disk. These limitations force current systems to either restore state piecemeal in a costly manner or capture too much state, leading to longer restore times and unpredictable performance. Futhermore, current memory primitives exposed by the OS make it difficult to reliably fetch data into memory and avoid costly runtime page faults. To overcome these barriers, we present Spice, an execution engine purpose-built for serverless snapshot/restore. Spice integrates directly with the OS to restore kernel state without costly replay and introduces dedicated primitives for restoring memory mappings efficiently and reliably. As a result, Spice delivers near-warm performance on cold restores from disk, reducing latency by up to 14.9x over state-of-the-art process-based systems and 10.6x over VM-based systems. This proves that high performance and memory elasticity no longer need to be a trade-off in serverless computing.</p></details> |  |

Our analysis shows that for these agents, the cost of running on serverless platforms can reach up to 70% of the cost of LLM API calls. This finding motivates the need for a more efficient, high-density serverless platform. We present TrEnv, a co-designed serverless platform that supports both container- and VM-based environments, optimized for the unique demands of LLM agents. TrEnv reduces startup latency and memory usage through repurposable sandboxes and memory templates, which enable fast reuse and restoration of execution environments. To further reduce overhead in VM-based agent workloads, TrEnv leverages browser sharing and a page cache bypassing mechanism. Evaluations show that TrEnv reduces P99 latency by up to 7X and memory usage by 48% in container-based settings, and achieves up to 58% lower P99 latency and 61% memory savings for VM-based agents compared to state-of-the-art systems like E2B.</p></details> | 38 pages |

Existing solutions such as "keep-alive" or "pre-warming" are costly and unreliable under bursty workloads. We propose universal workers, which are computational units capable of executing any function with minimal initialization overhead. Based on an analysis of production workload traces, our key insight is that requests in Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms show a highly skewed distribution, with most requests invoking a small subset of functions. We exploit this observation to approximate universal workers through locality groups and three-tier caching (handler, install, import). With this work, we aim to enable more efficient and scalable FaaS platforms capable of handling diverse workloads with minimal initialization overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the 2025 IEEE 18th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)</p></details> |

Despite its benefits, the distinct characteristics of serverless functions, such as ephemeral execution and fine-grained scalability, pose unique security challenges, particularly in open-source platforms like OpenFaaS. Existing approaches typically address isolated phases of the DevSecOps lifecycle, lacking an integrated and comprehensive security strategy. To bridge this gap, we propose FaaSGuard, a unified DevSecOps pipeline explicitly designed for open-source serverless environments. FaaSGuard systematically embeds lightweight, fail-closed security checks into every stage of the development lifecycle-planning, coding, building, deployment, and monitoring-effectively addressing threats such as injection attacks, hard-coded secrets, and resource exhaustion. We validate our approach empirically through a case study involving 20 real-world serverless functions from public GitHub repositories. Results indicate that FaaSGuard effectively detects and prevents critical vulnerabilities, demonstrating high precision (95%) and recall (91%) without significant disruption to established CI/CD practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Source Code Analysis & Manipulation (SCAM 2025)</p></details> |

In this work, we address these gaps by designing a serverless system that approximates the scaling behaviors of commercial providers, including AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Run. We systematically compare the performance and cost-efficiency of both synchronous and asynchronous autoscaling policies by replaying real-world workloads and varying key autoscaling parameters. We demonstrate that our open-source systems can closely replicate the operational characteristics of commercial platforms, enabling reproducible and transparent experimentation. By evaluating how autoscaling parameters affect latency, memory usage, and CPU overhead, we reveal several key findings. First, we find that serverless systems exhibit significant computational overhead due to instance churn equivalent to 10-40% of the CPU cycles spent on request handling, primarily originating from worker nodes. Second, we observe high memory allocation due to scaling policy: 2-10 times more than actively used. Finally, we demonstrate that reducing these overheads typically results in significant performance degradation in the current systems, underscoring the need for new, cost-efficient autoscaling strategies. Additionally, we employ a hybrid methodology that combines real control plane deployments with large-scale simulation to extend our evaluation closer to a production scale, thereby bridging the gap between small research clusters and real-world environments.</p></details> |  |

However, maintaining consistent application performance in serverless environments remains a significant challenge. The dynamic and transient nature of serverless functions makes it difficult to distinguish between benign and anomalous behavior, which in turn undermines the effectiveness of traditional anomaly detection methods. These conventional approaches, designed for stateful and long-running services, struggle in serverless settings where executions are short-lived, functions are isolated, and observability is limited. In this first comprehensive vision paper on anomaly detection for serverless systems, we systematically explore the unique challenges posed by this paradigm, including the absence of persistent state, inconsistent monitoring granularity, and the difficulty of correlating behaviors across distributed functions. We further examine a range of threats that manifest as anomalies, from classical Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks to serverless-specific threats such as Denial-of-Wallet (DoW) and cold start amplification. Building on these observations, we articulate a research agenda for next-generation detection frameworks that address the need for context-aware, multi-source data fusion, real-time, lightweight, privacy-preserving, and edge-cloud adaptive capabilities. Through the identification of key research directions and design principles, we aim to lay the foundation for the next generation of anomaly detection in cloud-native, serverless ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, Preprint accepted at 2025 IEEE International Conference on Service-Oriented System Engineering (SOSE)</p></details> |

However, current serverless inference platforms encounter the coarse-grained and static GPU resource allocation problems during scaling, which leads to high costs and Service Level Objective (SLO) violations in fluctuating workloads. Meanwhile, current platforms only support horizontal scaling for GPU inferences, thus the cold start problem further exacerbates the problems. In this paper, we propose HAS-GPU, an efficient Hybrid Auto-scaling Serverless architecture with fine-grained GPU allocation for deep learning inferences. HAS-GPU proposes an agile scheduler capable of allocating GPU Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) partitions and time quotas with arbitrary granularity and enables significant vertical quota scalability at runtime. To resolve performance uncertainty introduced by massive fine-grained resource configuration spaces, we propose the Resource-aware Performance Predictor (RaPP). Furthermore, we present an adaptive hybrid auto-scaling algorithm with both horizontal and vertical scaling to ensure inference SLOs and minimize GPU costs. The experiments demonstrated that compared to the mainstream serverless inference platform, HAS-GPU reduces function costs by an average of 10.8x with better SLO guarantees. Compared to state-of-the-art spatio-temporal GPU sharing serverless framework, HAS-GPU reduces function SLO violation by 4.8x and cost by 1.72x on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted by Euro-Par 2025</p></details> |

In a dynamic environment such as the 3D (Edge-Cloud-Space) Compute Continuum, serverless functions face additional challenges due to frequent changes in network topology. As satellites move in and out of the range of ground stations, functions must make multiple hops to access cloud services, leading to high-latency state access and unnecessary data transfers. In this paper, we present Databelt, a state management framework for serverless workflows designed for the dynamic environment of the 3D Compute Continuum. Databelt introduces an SLO-aware state propagation mechanism that enables the function state to move continuously in orbit. Databelt proactively offloads function states to the most suitable node, such that when functions execute, the data is already present on the execution node or nearby, thus minimizing state access latency and reducing the number of network hops. Additionally, Databelt introduces a function state fusion mechanism that abstracts state management for functions sharing the same serverless runtime. When functions are fused, Databelt seamlessly retrieves their state as a group, reducing redundant network and storage operations and improving overall workflow efficiency. Our experimental results show that Databelt reduces workflow execution time by up to 66% and increases throughput by 50% compared to the baselines. Furthermore, our results show that Databelt function state fusion reduces storage operations latency by up to 20%, by reducing repetitive storage requests for functions within the same runtime, ensuring efficient execution of serverless workflows in highly dynamic network environments such as the 3D Continuum.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comprehensive Review of Denial of Wallet Attacks in Serverless Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19284v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Denial of Wallet (DoW) attack poses a unique and growing threat to serverless architectures that rely on Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) models, exploiting the cost structure of pay-as-you-go billing to financially burden application owners. Unlike traditional Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, which aim to exhaust resources and disrupt service availability, DoW attacks focus on escalating costs without impacting service operation. This review traces the evolution of DoW research, from initial awareness and attack classification to advancements in detection and mitigation strategies. Key developments include the categorisation of attack types-such as Blast DDoW, Continual Inconspicuous DDoW, and Background Chained DDoW-and the creation of simulation tools like DoWTS, which enable safe experimentation and data generation. Recent advancements highlight machine learning approaches, including systems like Gringotts and DoWNet, which leverage deep learning and anomaly detection to identify malicious traffic patterns. Although substantial progress has been made, challenges persist, notably the lack of real-world data and the need for adaptive billing models. This is the first comprehensive literature review dedicated strictly to Denial of Wallet attacks, providing an in-depth analysis of their financial impacts, attack techniques, mitigation strategies, and detection mechanisms within serverless computing. The paper also presents the first detailed examination of simulation and data generation tools used for DoW research, addressing a critical gap in existing cybersecurity literature. By synthesising these key areas, this study serves as a foundational resource for future research and industry efforts in securing pay-as-you-go cloud environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Developers sometimes add a cache layer between the serverless runtime and the database to improve I/O latency. However, in a serverless environment, functions in the same workflow may be scheduled to different nodes with different caches, which can cause non-intuitive anomalies. This paper presents CausalMesh, a novel approach to causally consistent caching in environments where a computation may migrate from one machine to another, such as in serverless computing. CausalMesh is the first cache system that supports coordination-free and abort-free read/write operations and read transactions when clients roam among multiple servers. CausalMesh also supports read-write transactional causal consistency in the presence of client roaming, but at the cost of abort-freedom. We have formally verified CausalMesh's protocol in Dafny, and our experimental evaluation shows that CausalMesh has lower latency and higher throughput than existing proposals</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version from PVLDB Volume 17, Issue 13, 2024.

While Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs) offer a promising secure execution environment, their integration with serverless architectures currently faces fundamental limitations in key areas: security, performance, and resource efficiency. We present WALLET, a confidential computing system for secure serverless deployments to overcome these limitations. By employing nested confidential execution and a decoupled guest OS within CVMs, WALLET runs each function in a minimal "trustlet", significantly improving security through a reduced Trusted Computing Base (TCB). Furthermore, by leveraging a data-centric I/O architecture built upon a lightweight LibOS, WALLET optimizes network communication to address performance and resource efficiency challenges. Our evaluation shows that compared to CVM-based deployments, WALLET has 4.3x smaller TCB, improves end-to-end latency (15-93%), achieves higher function density (up to 907x), and reduces inter-function communication (up to 27x) and function chaining latency (16.7-30.2x); thus, WALLET offers a practical system for confidential serverless computing.</p></details> |  |

Its on-demand nature makes it especially appealing for latency-sensitive and bursty workloads. However, the cold start problem, i.e., where the platform incurs significant delay when provisioning new containers, remains the Achilles' heel of such platforms. This paper presents a predictive serverless scheduling framework based on Model Predictive Control to proactively mitigate cold starts, thereby improving end-to-end response time. By forecasting future invocations, the controller jointly optimizes container prewarming and request dispatching, improving latency while minimizing resource overhead. We implement our approach on Apache OpenWhisk, deployed on a Kubernetes-based testbed. Experimental results using real-world function traces and synthetic workloads demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 85% lower tail latency and a 34% reduction in resource usage.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, preprint accepted at MASCOTS 2025</p></details> |

With an Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) approach, frameworks like the Serverless Framework use YAML configurations to define and deploy APIs, tasks, workflows, and event-driven applications on cloud providers, promoting zero-friction development. As with any rapidly evolving ecosystem, there is a need for updated insights into how these tools are used in real-world projects. Building on the methodology established by the Wonderless dataset for serverless computing (and applying multiple new filtering steps), OpenLambdaVerse addresses this gap by creating a dataset of current GitHub repositories that use the Serverless Framework in applications that contain one or more AWS Lambda functions. We then analyze and characterize this dataset to get an understanding of the state-of-the-art in serverless architectures based on this stack. Through this analysis we gain important insights on the size and complexity of current applications, which languages and runtimes they employ, how are the functions triggered, the maturity of the projects, and their security practices (or lack of). OpenLambdaVerse thus offers a valuable, up-to-date resource for both practitioners and researchers that seek to better understand evolving serverless workloads.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 13th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering (IC2E 2025, accepted, to appear)</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose our vision of a native serverless data processing approach for spatiotemporal data: We break down queries into small subqueries which then leverage the near-instant scaling of Function-as-a-Service platforms to execute them in parallel.

This gives rise to present an abstract architecture of CNApp as dynamically re-configurable acyclic directed multi graph where vertices are microservices, and edges are the protocols. Generic mechanisms for such reconfigurations evidently correspond to higher-level functions (functionals). This implies also internal abstract architecture of microservice as a collection of event-triggered serverless functions (including functions implementing the protocols) that are composed into event-dependent data-flow graphs, and dynamically reconfigured at the runtime. Again, generic mechanisms for such compositions and reconfigurations correspond to functionals and higher order type theory like Coq https://coq.inria.fr/about-coq. Our contribution is strictly theoretical and relies on the abstract architecture of CNApp that is closely related to the calculus of functionals and relations. The proposed theoretical approach is an attempt to implement the original idea of programming at the function level postulated by John Backus 1978 \cite{Backus}; the idea that is still waiting to be implemented as a non-von Neumann programming language.</p></details> | <details><summary>short...</summary><p>shortened and concise FINAL version</p></details> |

As a result, serverless is becoming increasingly popular to support highly elastic and bursty workloads. However, existing platforms are supported by bloated virtualization stacks, which, combined with bursty and irregular invocations, lead to high memory and latency overheads. To reduce the virtualization stack bloat, we propose Hydra, a virtualized multi-language runtime and platform capable of hosting multiple sandboxes running concurrently. To fully leverage Hydra's virtualized runtime, we revisit the existing serverless platform design to make it colocation-aware across owners and functions, and to feature a caching layer of pre-allocated Hydra instances that can be used by different functions written in different languages to reduce cold starts. We also propose a snapshotting mechanism to checkpoint and restore individual sandboxes. By consolidating multiple serverless function invocations through Hydra, we improve the overall function density (ops/GB-sec) by 2.41x on average compared to OpenWhisk runtimes, the state-of-the-art single-language runtimes used in most serverless platforms, and by 1.43x on average compared to Knative runtimes supporting invocation colocation within the same function. When reproducing the Azure Functions trace, our serverless platform operating Hydra instances reduces the overall memory footprint by 21.3-43.9% compared to operating OpenWhisk instances and by 14.5-30% compared to operating Knative instances. Hydra eliminates cold starts thanks to the pool of pre-warmed runtime instances, reducing p99 latency by 45.3-375.5x compared to OpenWhisk and by 1.9-51.4x compared to Knative.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches often rely on uniform reactive policies or unconditioned predictive models, ignoring both workload semantics and prediction uncertainty. We present AAPA, an archetype-aware predictive autoscaler that classifies workloads into four behavioral patterns -- SPIKE, PERIODIC, RAMP, and STATIONARY -- and applies tailored scaling strategies with confidence-based adjustments. To support reproducible evaluation, we release AAPAset, a weakly labeled dataset of 300,000 Azure Functions workload windows spanning diverse patterns. AAPA reduces SLO violations by up to 50% and lowers latency by 40% compared to Kubernetes HPA, albeit at 2-8x higher resource usage under spike-dominated conditions. To assess trade-offs, we propose the Resource Efficiency Index (REI), a unified metric balancing performance, cost, and scaling smoothness.

| **[Making Serverless Computing Extensible: A Case Study of Serverless Data Analytics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11929v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing has attracted a broad range of applications due to its ease of use and resource elasticity. However, developing serverless applications often poses a dilemma -- relying on general-purpose serverless platforms can fall short of delivering satisfactory performance for complex workloads, whereas building application-specific serverless systems undermines the simplicity and generality. In this paper, we propose an extensible design principle for serverless computing. We argue that a platform should enable developers to extend system behaviors for domain-specialized optimizations while retaining a shared, easy-to-use serverless environment. We take data analytics as a representative serverless use case and realize this design principle in Proteus. Proteus introduces a novel abstraction of decision workflows, allowing developers to customize control-plane behaviors for improved application performance. Preliminary results show that Proteus's prototype effectively optimizes analytical query execution and supports fine-grained resource sharing across diverse applications.</p></details> |  |

This optimization reduces cold-start time when booting and loading dependencies at runtime inside a function container. Previous research has extensively focused on reducing cold-start latency for specific functions. However, little attention has been given to skewed production workloads. In such cases, cross-function optimization becomes essential. Without cross-function optimization, a cloud provider is left with two equally poor options: (i) Either the cloud provider gives up optimization for each function in the long tail (which is slow); or (ii) the cloud provider applies function-specific optimizations (e.g., cache function images) to every function in the long tail (which violates the vendor's cache constraints). HotSwap demonstrates cross-function optimization using a novel pre-warming strategy. In this strategy, a pre-initialized live dependency image is migrated to the new function instance. At the same time, HotSwap respects the provider's cache constraints, because a single pre-warmed dependency image in the cache can be shared among all serverless functions that require that image. HotSwap has been tested on seven representative functions from FunctionBench. In those tests, HotSwap accelerates dependency loading for those serverless functions with large dependency requirements by a factor ranging from 2.2 to 3.2. Simulation experiments using Azure traces indicate that HotSwap can save 88\% of space, compared with a previous function-specific method, PreBaking, when sharing a dependency image among ten different functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures.

However, existing serverless platforms lack efficient support for GPUs, hindering their ability to deliver high-performance inference. In this paper, we present Torpor, a serverless platform for GPU-efficient, low-latency inference. To enable efficient sharing of a node's GPUs among numerous inference functions, Torpor maintains models in main memory and dynamically swaps them onto GPUs upon request arrivals (i.e., late binding with model swapping). Torpor uses various techniques, including asynchronous API redirection, GPU runtime sharing, pipelined model execution, and efficient GPU memory management, to minimize latency overhead caused by model swapping. Additionally, we design an interference-aware request scheduling algorithm that utilizes high-speed GPU interconnects to meet latency service-level objectives (SLOs) for individual inference functions. We have implemented Torpor and evaluated its performance in a production environment. Utilizing late binding and model swapping, Torpor can concurrently serve hundreds of inference functions on a worker node with 4 GPUs, while achieving latency performance comparable to native execution, where each model is cached exclusively on a GPU. Pilot deployment in a leading commercial serverless cloud shows that Torpor reduces the GPU provisioning cost by 70% and 65% for users and the platform, respectively.</p></details> |  |

In such Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms, scheduling is an integral task, but current scheduling algorithms often struggle with maintaining balanced loads, minimizing cold starts, and adapting to commonly occurring bursty workloads. In this work, we propose pull-based scheduling as a novel scheduling algorithm for serverless computing. Our key idea is to decouple worker selection from task assignment, with idle workers requesting new tasks proactively. Experimental evaluation on an open-source FaaS platform shows that pull-based scheduling, compared to other existing scheduling algorithms, significantly improves the performance and load balancing of serverless workloads, especially under high concurrency. The proposed algorithm improves response latencies by 14.9% compared to hash-based scheduling, reduces the frequency of cold starts from 43% to 30%, increases throughput by 8.3%, and achieves a more even load distribution by 12.9% measured by the requests assigned per worker.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the 2025 IEEE 25th International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing (CCGrid)</p></details> |

However, the inherent cold start problem in serverless ML inference systems, particularly the time-consuming model loading process, remains a significant bottleneck. Utilizing pipelined model loading improves efficiency but still suffer from pipeline stalls due to sequential layer construction and monolithic weight loading. In this paper, we propose \textit{Cicada}, a novel pipeline optimization framework that coordinates computational, storage, and scheduling resources through three key mechanisms: (1) \textit{MiniLoader}: which reduces layer construction overhead by opportunistically optimizing parameter initialization; (2) \textit{WeightDecoupler}: decoupling weight file processing from layer construction, enabling asynchronous weight retrieval and out-of-order weight application; (3) \textit{Priority-Aware Scheduler}: dynamically allocating resources to ensure high-priority inference tasks are executed promptly. Our experimental results demonstrate that Cicada achieves significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art PISeL framework. Specifically, Cicada reduces end-to-end inference latency by an average of 61.59\%, with the MiniLoader component contributing the majority of this optimization (53.41\%), and the WeightDecoupler achieves up to 26.17\% improvement. Additionally, Cicada achieves up to 2.52x speedup in the inference pipeline utlization compared to PISeL.</p></details> | 13pages, 14 figures |

This restricts performance optimization, cost reduction, and availability of applications. However, orchestrating serverless workflows on Jointcloud FaaS systems faces two main challenges: 1) Additional overhead caused by centralized cross-cloud orchestration; and 2) A lack of reliable failover and fault-tolerant mechanisms for cross-cloud serverless workflows. To address these challenges, we propose Joint$λ$, a distributed runtime system designed to orchestrate serverless workflows on multiple FaaS systems without relying on a centralized orchestrator. Joint$λ$ introduces a compatibility layer, Backend-Shim, leveraging inter-cloud heterogeneity to optimize makespan and reduce costs with on-demand billing. By using function-side orchestration instead of centralized nodes, it enables independent function invocations and data transfers, reducing cross-cloud communication overhead. For high availability, it ensures exactly-once execution via datastores and failover mechanisms for serverless workflows on Jointcloud FaaS systems. We validate Joint$λ$ on two heterogeneous FaaS systems, AWS and ALiYun, with four workflows. Compared to the most advanced commercial orchestration services for single-cloud serverless workflows, Joint$λ$ reduces up to 3.3$\times$ latency, saving up to 65\% cost. Joint$λ$ is also faster than the state-of-the-art orchestrators for cross-cloud serverless workflows up to 4.0$\times$, reducing up to 4.5$\times$ cost and providing strong execution guarantees.</p></details> |  |

However, our analysis reveals that current serverless can effectively serve general LLM but fail with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) inference due to three key limitations: 1) massive parameter redundancy among functions where 99% of weights are unnecessarily duplicated, 2) costly artifact loading latency beyond LLM loading, and 3) magnified resource contention when serving multiple LoRA LLMs. These inefficiencies lead to massive GPU wastage, increased Time-To-First-Token (TTFT), and high monetary costs. We propose ServerlessLoRA, a novel serverless inference system designed for faster and cheaper LoRA LLM serving. ServerlessLoRA enables secure backbone LLM sharing across isolated LoRA functions to reduce redundancy. We design a pre-loading method that pre-loads comprehensive LoRA artifacts to minimize cold-start latency. Furthermore, ServerlessLoRA employs contention aware batching and offloading to mitigate GPU resource conflicts during bursty workloads. Experiment on industrial workloads demonstrates that ServerlessLoRA reduces TTFT by up to 86% and cuts monetary costs by up to 89% compared to state-of-the-art LLM inference solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Palladium: A DPU-enabled Multi-Tenant Serverless Cloud over Zero-copy Multi-node RDMA Fabrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11339v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing promises enhanced resource efficiency and lower user costs, yet is burdened by a heavyweight, CPU-bound data plane. Prior efforts exploiting shared memory reduce overhead locally but fall short when scaling across nodes. Furthermore, serverless environments can have unpredictable and large-scale multi-tenancy, leading to contention for shared network resources. We present Palladium, a DPU-centric serverless data plane that reduces the CPU burden and enables efficient, zero-copy communication in multi-tenant serverless clouds. Despite the limited general-purpose processing capability of the DPU cores, Palladium strategically exploits the DPU's potential by (1) offloading data transmission to high-performance NIC cores via RDMA, combined with intra-node shared memory to eliminate data copies across nodes, and (2) enabling cross-processor (CPU-DPU) shared memory to eliminate redundant data movement, which overwhelms wimpy DPU cores. At the core of Palladium is the DPU-enabled network engine (DNE) -- a lightweight reverse proxy that isolates RDMA resources from tenant functions, orchestrates inter-node RDMA flows, and enforces fairness under contention. To further reduce CPU involvement, Palladium performs early HTTP/TCP-to-RDMA transport conversion at the cloud ingress, bridging the protocol mismatch before client traffic enters the RDMA fabric, thus avoiding costly protocol translation along the critical path. We show that careful selection of RDMA primitives (i.e., two-sided instead of one-sided) significantly affects the zero-copy data plane. Our preliminary experimental results show that enabling DPU offloading in Palladium improves RPS by 20.9x. The latency is reduced by a factor of 21x in the best case, all the while saving up to 7 CPU cores, and only consuming two wimpy DPU cores.</p></details> |  |
| **[ABase: the Multi-Tenant NoSQL Serverless Database for Diverse and Dynamic Workloads in Large-scale Cloud Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07692v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-tenant architectures enhance the elasticity and resource utilization of NoSQL databases by allowing multiple tenants to co-locate and share resources. However, in large-scale cloud environments, the diverse and dynamic nature of workloads poses significant challenges for multi-tenant NoSQL databases. Based on our practical observations, we have identified three crucial challenges: (1) the impact of caching on performance isolation, as cache hits alter request execution and resource consumption, leading to inaccurate traffic control; (2) the dynamic changes in traffic, with changes in tenant traffic trends causing throttling or resource wastage, and changes in access distribution causing hot key pressure or cache hit ratio drops; and (3) the imbalanced layout of data nodes due to tenants' diverse resource requirements, leading to low resource utilization. To address these challenges, we introduce ABase, a multi-tenant NoSQL serverless database developed at ByteDance. ABase introduces a two-layer caching mechanism with a cache-aware isolation mechanism to ensure accurate resource consumption estimates. Furthermore, ABase employs a predictive autoscaling policy to dynamically adjust resources in response to tenant traffic changes and a multi-resource rescheduling algorithm to balance resource utilization across data nodes. With these innovations, ABase has successfully served ByteDance's large-scale cloud environment, supporting a total workload that has achieved a peak QPS of over 13 billion and total storage exceeding 1 EB.</p></details> | SIGMOD 2025 accepted |

However, deploying serverless functions across dynamic and heterogeneous environments such as the 3D (Edge-Cloud-Space) Continuum introduces additional complexity. Each layer of the 3D Continuum shows different performance capabilities and costs according to workload characteristics. Cloud services alone often show significant differences in performance and pricing for similar functions, further complicating cost management. Additionally, serverless workflows consist of functions with diverse characteristics, requiring a granular understanding of performance and cost trade-offs across different infrastructure layers to be able to address them individually. In this paper, we present Cosmos, a cost- and a performance-cost-tradeoff model for serverless workflows that identifies key factors that affect cost changes across different workloads and cloud providers. We present a case study analyzing the main drivers that influence the costs of serverless workflows. We demonstrate how to classify the costs of serverless workflows in leading cloud providers AWS and GCP. Our results show that for data-intensive functions, data transfer and state management costs contribute to up to 75% of the costs in AWS and 52% in GCP. For compute-intensive functions such as AI inference, the cost results show that BaaS services are the largest cost driver, reaching up to 83% in AWS and 97% in GCP.</p></details> |  |
| **[CWASI: A WebAssembly Runtime Shim for Inter-function Communication in the Serverless Edge-Cloud Continuum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21503v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless Computing brings advantages to the Edge-Cloud continuum, like simplified programming and infrastructure management. In composed workflows, where serverless functions need to exchange data constantly, serverless platforms rely on remote services such as object storage and key-value stores as a common approach to exchange data. In WebAssembly, functions leverage WebAssembly System Interface to connect to the network and exchange data via remote services. As a consequence, co-located serverless functions need remote services to exchange data, increasing latency and adding network overhead. To mitigate this problem, in this paper, we introduce CWASI: a WebAssembly OCI-compliant runtime shim that determines the best inter-function data exchange approach based on the serverless function locality. CWASI introduces a three-mode communication model for the Serverless Edge-Cloud continuum. This communication model enables CWASI Shim to optimize inter-function communication for co-located functions by leveraging the function host mechanisms. Experimental results show that CWASI reduces the communication latency between the co-located serverless functions by up to 95% and increases the communication throughput by up to 30x.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the Eighth ACM/IEEE Symposium on Edge Computing</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Serverless Cold Start: Reducing Library Loading Overhead by Profile-guided Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19283v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing abstracts away server management, enabling automatic scaling, efficient resource utilization, and cost-effective pricing models. However, despite these advantages, it faces the significant challenge of cold-start latency, adversely impacting end-to-end performance. Our study shows that many serverless functions initialize libraries that are rarely or never used under typical workloads, thus introducing unnecessary overhead. Although existing static analysis techniques can identify unreachable libraries, they fail to address workload-dependent inefficiencies, resulting in limited performance improvements. To overcome these limitations, we present SLIMSTART, a profile-guided optimization tool designed to identify and mitigate inefficient library usage patterns in serverless applications. By leveraging statistical sampling and call-path profiling, SLIMSTART collects runtime library usage data, generates detailed optimization reports, and applies automated code transformations to reduce cold-start overhead. Furthermore, SLIMSTART integrates seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines, enabling adaptive monitoring and continuous optimizations tailored to evolving workloads. Through extensive evaluation across three benchmark suites and four real-world serverless applications, SLIMSTART achieves up to a 2.30X speedup in initialization latency, a 2.26X improvement in end-to-end latency, and a 1.51X reduction in memory usage, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing cold-start inefficiencies and optimizing resource utilization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 45th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS 2025)</p></details> |

With latency propagation effects becoming increasingly prominent, step-wise resource tuning is required to address Service-Level-Objectives (SLOs). Modern processors' allowance for fine-grained Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), coupled with serverless workflows' intermittent nature, presents a unique opportunity to reduce power while meeting SLOs. We introduce $Ω$kypous, an SLO-driven DVFS framework for serverless workflows. $Ω$kypous employs a grey-box model that predicts functions' execution latency and power under different Core and Uncore frequency combinations. Based on these predictions and the timing slacks between workflow functions, $Ω$kypous uses a closed-loop control mechanism to dynamically adjust Core and Uncore frequencies, thus minimizing power consumption without compromising predefined end-to-end latency constraints. Our evaluation on real-world traces from Azure, against state-of-the-art power management frameworks, demonstrates an average power consumption reduction of 16\%, while consistently maintaining low SLO violation rates (1.8\%), when operating under power caps.</p></details> |  |

However, current orbital edge computing architectures are inflexible, requiring custom mission planning and high upfront development costs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach: shared Earth observation satellites that are operated by a central provider but used by multiple tenants. Each tenant can execute their own logic on-board the satellite to filter, prioritize, and analyze sensor data. We introduce Trabant, a serverless architecture for shared satellite platforms, leveraging the Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) paradigm and time-shifted computing. This architecture abstracts operational complexities, enabling dynamic scheduling under satellite resource constraints, reducing deployment overhead, and aligning event-driven satellite observations with intermittent computation. We present the design of Trabant, demonstrate its capabilities with a proof-of-concept prototype, and evaluate it using real satellite computing telemetry data. Our findings suggest that Trabant can significantly reduce mission planning overheads, offering a scalable and efficient platform for diverse Earth observation missions.</p></details> |  |

However, resource allocation for workflows, particularly those with branching structures, is complicated by cold starts and network delays between dependent functions, significantly degrading execution efficiency and response times. In this paper, we propose the Invocation Concurrency Prediction-Based Scaling (ICPS) algorithm to address these challenges. ICPS employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict function concurrency, dynamically pre-warming function instances, and an affinity-based deployment strategy to co-locate dependent functions on the same worker node, minimizing network latency. The experimental results demonstrate that ICPS consistently outperforms existing approaches in diverse scenarios. The results confirm ICPS as a robust and scalable solution for optimizing serverless workflow execution.</p></details> |  |

This work analyzes the applicability of serverless services for running the STAR aligner, which is known for its accuracy and large memory requirement. This presents a challenge, as serverless services were designed for light and short tasks. Nevertheless, we successfully deploy a STAR-based pipeline on AWS ECS service, propose multiple optimizations, and perform experiment with 17 TBs of data. Results are compared against standard virtual machine (VM) based solution showing that serverless is a valid alternative for small-scale batch processing. However, in large-scale where efficiency matters the most, VMs are still recommended.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CCGrid2025 conference in the poster format</p></details> |

However, this produces a dependency on provider resources. Moreover, managing and executing tasks and data in these environments are challenges that commonly arise when building an EOS. This paper presents GeoNimbus, a serverless framework for composing and deploying spatio-temporal EOS on multiple infrastructures, e.g., on-premise resources and public or private clouds. This framework organizes EOS tasks as functions and automatically manages their deployment, invocation, scalability, and monitoring in the cloud. GeoNimbus framework enables organizations to reuse and share available functions to compose multiple EOS. We use this framework to implement EOS as a service for conducting a case study focused on measuring water resource changes in a lake in the south of Mexico.

| **[SeBS-Flow: Benchmarking Serverless Cloud Function Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03480v3)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing has emerged as a prominent paradigm, with a significant adoption rate among cloud customers. While this model offers advantages such as abstraction from the deployment and resource scheduling, it also poses limitations in handling complex use cases due to the restricted nature of individual functions. Serverless workflows address this limitation by orchestrating multiple functions into a cohesive application. However, existing serverless workflow platforms exhibit significant differences in their programming models and infrastructure, making fair and consistent performance evaluations difficult in practice. To address this gap, we propose the first serverless workflow benchmarking suite SeBS-Flow, providing a platform-agnostic workflow model that enables consistent benchmarking across various platforms. SeBS-Flow includes six real-world application benchmarks and four microbenchmarks representing different computational patterns. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on three major cloud platforms, assessing performance, cost, scalability, and runtime deviations. We make our benchmark suite open-source, enabling rigorous and comparable evaluations of serverless workflows over time.</p></details> |  |

Many LLM inference tasks rely on the same base model (e.g., LoRA). To leverage this, PipeBoost introduces fault-tolerant pipeline parallelism across both model loading and inference stages. This approach maximizes aggregate PCIe bandwidth and parallel computation across GPUs, enabling faster generation of the first token. PipeBoost also introduces recovery techniques that enable uninterrupted inference services by utilizing the shared advantages of multiple GPUs. Experimental results show that, compared to state-of-the-art low-latency LLM serving systems, PipeBoost reduces inference latency by 31% to 49.8%. For certain models (e.g., OPT-1.3B), PipeBoost achieves cold-start latencies in the range of a few hundred microseconds.</p></details> |  |
| **[FaaSMT: Lightweight Serverless Framework for Intrusion Detection Using Merkle Tree and Task Inlining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06532v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The serverless platform aims to facilitate cloud applications' straightforward deployment, scaling, and management. Unfortunately, the distributed nature of serverless computing makes it difficult to port traditional security tools directly. The existing serverless solutions primarily identify potential threats or performance bottlenecks through post-analysis of modified operating system audit logs, detection of encrypted traffic offloading, or the collection of runtime metrics. However, these methods often prove inadequate for comprehensively detecting communication violations across functions. This limitation restricts the real-time log monitoring and validation capabilities in distributed environments while impeding the maintenance of minimal communication overhead. Therefore, this paper presents FaaSMT, which aims to fill this gap by addressing research questions related to security checks and the optimization of performance and costs in serverless applications. This framework employs parallel processing for the collection of distributed data logs, incorporating Merkle Tree algorithms and heuristic optimisation methods to achieve adaptive inline security task execution. The results of experimental trials demonstrate that FaaSMT is capable of effectively identifying major attack types (e.g., Denial of Wallet (DoW) and Business Logic attacks), thereby providing comprehensive monitoring and validation of function executions while significantly reducing performance overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dilu: Enabling GPU Resourcing-on-Demand for Serverless DL Serving via Introspective Elasticity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05130v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing, with its ease of management, auto-scaling, and cost-effectiveness, is widely adopted by deep learning (DL) applications. DL workloads, especially with large language models, require substantial GPU resources to ensure QoS. However, it is prone to produce GPU fragments (e.g., 15\%-94\%) in serverless DL systems due to the dynamicity of workloads and coarse-grained static GPU allocation mechanisms, gradually eroding the profits offered by serverless elasticity. Different from classical serverless systems that only scale horizontally, we present introspective elasticity (IE), a fine-grained and adaptive two-dimensional co-scaling mechanism to support GPU resourcing-on-demand for serverless DL tasks. Based on this insight, we build Dilu, a cross-layer and GPU-based serverless DL system with IE support. First, Dilu provides multi-factor profiling for DL tasks with efficient pruning search methods. Second, Dilu adheres to the resourcing-complementary principles in scheduling to improve GPU utilization with QoS guarantees. Third, Dilu adopts an adaptive 2D co-scaling method to enhance the elasticity of GPU provisioning in real time. Evaluations show that it can dynamically adjust the resourcing of various DL functions with low GPU fragmentation (10\%-46\% GPU defragmentation), high throughput (up to 1.8$\times$ inference and 1.1$\times$ training throughput increment) and QoS guarantees (11\%-71\% violation rate reduction), compared to the SOTA baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncoordinated Access to Serverless Computing in MEC Systems for IoT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00375v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Edge computing is a promising solution to enable low-latency IoT applications, by shifting computation from remote data centers to local devices, less powerful but closer to the end user devices. However, this creates the challenge on how to best assign clients to edge nodes offering compute capabilities. So far, two antithetical architectures are proposed: centralized resource orchestration or distributed overlay. In this work we explore a third way, called uncoordinated access, which consists in letting every device exploring multiple opportunities, to opportunistically embrace the heterogeneity of network and load conditions towards diverse edge nodes. In particular, our contribution is intended for emerging serverless IoT applications, which do not have a state on the edge nodes executing tasks. We model the proposed system as a set of M/M/1 queues and show that it achieves a smaller jitter delay than single edge node allocation. Furthermore, we compare uncoordinated access with state-of-the-art centralized and distributed alternatives in testbed experiments under more realistic conditions. Based on the results, our proposed approach, which requires a tiny fraction of the complexity of the alternatives in both the device and network components, is very effective in using the network resources, while incurring only a small penalty in terms of increased compute load and high percentiles of delay.</p></details> |  |
| **[AARC: Automated Affinity-aware Resource Configuration for Serverless Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20846v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing is increasingly adopted for its ability to manage complex, event-driven workloads without the need for infrastructure provisioning. However, traditional resource allocation in serverless platforms couples CPU and memory, which may not be optimal for all functions. Existing decoupling approaches, while offering some flexibility, are not designed to handle the vast configuration space and complexity of serverless workflows. In this paper, we propose AARC, an innovative, automated framework that decouples CPU and memory resources to provide more flexible and efficient provisioning for serverless workloads. AARC is composed of two key components: Graph-Centric Scheduler, which identifies critical paths in workflows, and Priority Configurator, which applies priority scheduling techniques to optimize resource allocation. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that AARC achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with total search time reductions of 85.8% and 89.6%, and cost savings of 49.6% and 61.7%, respectively, while maintaining SLO compliance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 62nd Design Automation Conference (DAC 2025)</p></details> |
| **[It Takes Two to Tango: Serverless Workflow Serving via Bilaterally Engaged Resource Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14320v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless platforms typically adopt an early-binding approach for function sizing, requiring developers to specify an immutable size for each function within a workflow beforehand. Accounting for potential runtime variability, developers must size functions for worst-case scenarios to ensure service-level objectives (SLOs), resulting in significant resource inefficiency. To address this issue, we propose Janus, a novel resource adaptation framework for serverless platforms. Janus employs a late-binding approach, allowing function sizes to be dynamically adapted based on runtime conditions. The main challenge lies in the information barrier between the developer and the provider: developers lack access to runtime information, while providers lack domain knowledge about the workflow. To bridge this gap, Janus allows developers to provide hints containing rules and options for resource adaptation. Providers then follow these hints to dynamically adjust resource allocation at runtime based on real-time function execution information, ensuring compliance with SLOs. We implement Janus and conduct extensive experiments with real-world serverless workflows. Our results demonstrate that Janus enhances resource efficiency by up to 34.7% compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in the 39th IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS)</p></details> |
| **[KiSS: A Novel Container Size-Aware Memory Management Policy for Serverless in Edge-Cloud Continuum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12540v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing has revolutionized cloud architectures by enabling developers to deploy event-driven applications via lightweight, self-contained virtualized containers. However, serverless frameworks face critical cold-start challenges in resource-constrained edge environments, where traditional solutions fall short. The limitations are especially pronounced in edge environments, where heterogeneity and resource constraints exacerbate inefficiencies in resource utilization. This paper introduces KiSS (Keep it Separated Serverless), a static, container size-aware memory management policy tailored for the edge-cloud continuum. The design of KiSS is informed by a detailed workload analysis that identifies critical patterns in container size, invocation frequency, and memory contention. Guided by these insights, KiSS partitions memory pools into categories for small, frequently invoked containers and larger, resource-intensive ones, ensuring efficient resource utilization while minimizing cold starts and inter-function interference. Using a discrete-event simulator, we evaluate KiSS on edge-cluster environments with real-world-inspired workloads. Results show that KiSS reduces cold-start percentages by 60% and function drops by 56.5%, achieving significant performance gains in resource-constrained settings. This work underscores the importance of workload-driven design in advancing serverless efficiency at the edge.</p></details> |  |

It allows software engineers to develop cloud applications as a set of functions (called serverless functions). However, accurately measuring the performance (i.e., end-to-end response latency) of serverless functions is challenging due to the highly dynamic nature of the environment in which they run. To tackle this problem, a potential solution is to apply checks of performance testing techniques to determine how many repetitions of a given serverless function across a range of inputs are needed to cater to the performance fluctuation. However, the available literature lacks performance testing approaches designed explicitly for serverless computing. In this paper, we propose SCOPE, the first serverless computing-oriented performance testing approach. SCOPE takes into account the unique performance characteristics of serverless functions, such as their short execution durations and on-demand triggering. As such, SCOPE is designed as a fine-grained analysis approach. SCOPE incorporates the accuracy check and the consistency check to obtain the accurate and reliable performance of serverless functions. The evaluation shows that SCOPE provides testing results with 97.25% accuracy, 33.83 percentage points higher than the best currently available technique. Moreover, the superiority of SCOPE over the state-of-the-art holds on all functions that we study.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)</p></details> |

However, this generation has been limited to code snippets. Going one step further, our desideratum is to automatically generate architectural components. This would not only speed up development time, but would also enable us to eventually completely skip the development phase, moving directly from design decisions to deployment. To this end, we conduct an exploratory study on the capability of LLMs to generate architectural components for Functions as a Service (FaaS), commonly known as serverless functions. The small size of their architectural components make this architectural style amenable for generation using current LLMs compared to other styles like monoliths and microservices. We perform the study by systematically selecting open source serverless repositories, masking a serverless function and utilizing state of the art LLMs provided with varying levels of context information about the overall system to generate the masked function. We evaluate correctness through existing tests present in the repositories and use metrics from the Software Engineering (SE) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) domains to evaluate code quality and the degree of similarity between human and LLM generated code respectively. Along with our findings, we also present a discussion on the path forward for using GenAI in architectural component generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Software Architecture (ICSA) 2025 Main Track (https://conf.researchr.org/home/icsa-2025)</p></details> |

Serverless computing and cloud functions offer attractive benefits such as elasticity and cost-effectiveness, but are difficult to apply to data-intensive workloads. Jointly addressing these two main challenges, we present SQUASH, the first fully serverless vector search solution with rich support for hybrid queries. It features OSQ, an optimized and highly parallelizable quantization-based approach for vectors and attributes. Its segment-based storage mechanism enables significant compression in resource-constrained settings and offers efficient dimensional extraction operations. SQUASH performs a single distributed pass to guarantee the return of sufficiently many vectors satisfying the filter predicate, achieving high accuracy and avoiding redundant computation for vectors which fail the predicate. A multi-level search workflow is introduced to prune most vectors early to minimize the load on Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) instances. SQUASH is designed to identify and utilize retention of relevant data in re-used runtime containers, which eliminates redundant I/O and reduces costs. Finally, we demonstrate a new tree-based method for rapid FaaS invocation, enabling the bi-directional flow of data via request/response payloads. Experiments comparing SQUASH with state-of-the-art serverless vector search solutions and server-based baselines on vector search benchmarks confirm significant performance improvements at a lower cost.</p></details> |  |

Although modern data processing systems embrace serverless storage, such as Amazon S3, they continue to manage their compute resources as servers. This is challenging for unpredictable workloads, leaving clusters often underutilized. Recent research shows the potential of serverless compute resources, such as cloud functions, for elastic data processing, but also sees limitations in performance robustness and cost efficiency for long running workloads. These challenges require holistic approaches across the system stack. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no end-to-end data processing system built entirely on serverless infrastructure. In this paper, we present Skyrise, our effort towards building the first fully serverless SQL query processor. Skyrise exploits the elasticity of its underlying infrastructure, while alleviating the inherent limitations with a number of adaptive and cost-aware techniques. We show that both Skyrise's performance and cost are competitive to other cloud data systems for terabyte-scale queries of the analytical TPC-H benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cost Optimization for Serverless Edge Computing with Budget Constraints using Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12783v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing adopts a pay-as-you-go billing model where applications are executed in stateless and shortlived containers triggered by events, resulting in a reduction of monetary costs and resource utilization. However, existing platforms do not provide an upper bound for the billing model which makes the overall cost unpredictable, precluding many organizations from managing their budgets. Due to the diverse ranges of serverless functions and the heterogeneous capacity of edge devices, it is challenging to receive near-optimal solutions for deployment cost in a polynomial time. In this paper, we investigated the function scheduling problem with a budget constraint for serverless computing in wireless networks. Users and IoT devices are sending requests to edge nodes, improving the latency perceived by users. We propose two online scheduling algorithms based on reinforcement learning, incorporating several important characteristics of serverless functions. Via extensive simulations, we justify the superiority of the proposed algorithm by comparing with an ILP solver (Midaco). Our results indicate that the proposed algorithms efficiently approximate the results of Midaco within a factor of 1.03 while our decision-making time is 5 orders of magnitude less than that of Midaco.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE ICC 2025</p></details> |

Recent work proposed using domain-specific languages to express per-function policies, e.g., policies that enforce the allocation on nodes that enjoy lower latencies to databases and services used by the function. Here, we focus on affinity-aware scenarios, i.e., where, for performance and functional requirements, the allocation of a function depends on the presence/absence of other functions on nodes. We present aAPP, an extension of a declarative, platform-agnostic language that captures affinity-aware scheduling at the FaaS level. We implement an aAPP-based prototype on Apache OpenWhisk. Besides proving that a FaaS platform can capture affinity awareness using aAPP and improve performance in affinity-aware scenarios, we use our prototype to show that aAPP imposes no noticeable overhead in scenarios without affinity constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures, 1 listing. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2407.14159</p></details> |

While monolithic systems run fully on virtual servers, recent systems embrace cloud infrastructure and utilize the disaggregation of compute and storage to scale them independently. The introduction of serverless compute services, such as AWS Lambda, enables finer-grained and elastic scalability within these systems. Prior work shows the viability of serverless infrastructure for scalable data processing yet also sees limitations due to variable performance and cost overhead, in particular for networking and storage. In this paper, we perform a detailed analysis of the performance and cost characteristics of serverless infrastructure in the data processing context. We base our analysis on a large series of micro-benchmarks across different compute and storage services, as well as end-to-end workloads. To enable our analysis, we propose the Skyrise serverless evaluation platform. For the widely used serverless infrastructure of AWS, our analysis reveals distinct boundaries for performance variability in serverless networks and storage. We further present cost break-even points for serverless compute and storage. These insights provide guidance on when and how serverless infrastructure can be efficiently used for data processing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unveiling Overlooked Performance Variance in Serverless Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04309v2)** | 2025-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing is an emerging cloud computing paradigm for developing applications at the function level, known as serverless functions. Due to the highly dynamic execution environment, multiple identical runs of the same serverless function can yield different performance, specifically in terms of end-to-end response latency. However, surprisingly, our analysis of serverless computing-related papers published in top-tier conferences highlights that the research community lacks awareness of the performance variance problem, with only 38.38% of these papers employing multiple runs for quantifying it. To further investigate, we analyze the performance of 72 serverless functions collected from these papers. Our findings reveal that the performance of these serverless functions can differ by up to 338.76% (44.28% on average) across different runs. Moreover, 61.11% of these functions produce unreliable performance results, with a low number of repetitions commonly employed in the serverless computing literature. Our study highlights a lack of awareness in the serverless computing community regarding the well-known performance variance problem in software engineering. The empirical results illustrate the substantial magnitude of this variance, emphasizing that ignoring the variance can affect research reproducibility and result reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication in Empirical Software Engineering!</p></details> |

In practice, DTs require proper modeling, coherent development and seamless deployment along cloud and edge landscapes relying on established patterns to reduce operational costs. In this work, we propose KTWIN a Kubernetes-based Serverless Platform for Digital Twins. KTWIN was developed using the state-of-the-art open-source Cloud Native tools, allowing DT operators to easily define models through open standards and configure details of the underlying services and infrastructure. The experiments carried out with the developed prototype show that KTWIN can provide a higher level of abstraction to model and deploy a Digital Twin use case without compromising the solution scalability. The tests performed also show cost savings ranging between 60% and 80% compared to overprovisioned scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Distributed Deployment of Mixture-of-Experts Model Inference in Serverless Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05313v1)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advancement of serverless computing, running machine learning (ML) inference services over a serverless platform has been advocated, given its labor-free scalability and cost effectiveness. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have been a dominant type of model architectures to enable large models nowadays, with parallel expert networks. Serving large MoE models on serverless computing is potentially beneficial, but has been underexplored due to substantial challenges in handling the skewed expert popularity and scatter-gather communication bottleneck in MoE model execution, for cost-efficient serverless MoE deployment and performance guarantee. We study optimized MoE model deployment and distributed inference serving on a serverless platform, that effectively predict expert selection, pipeline communication with model execution, and minimize the overall billed cost of serving MoE models. Especially, we propose a Bayesian optimization framework with multi-dimensional epsilon-greedy search to learn expert selections and optimal MoE deployment achieving optimal billed cost, including: 1) a Bayesian decision-making method for predicting expert popularity; 2) flexibly pipelined scatter-gather communication; and 3) an optimal model deployment algorithm for distributed MoE serving. Extensive experiments on AWS Lambda show that our designs reduce the billed cost of all MoE layers by at least 75.67% compared to CPU clusters while maintaining satisfactory inference throughput. As compared to LambdaML in serverless computing, our designs achieves 43.41% lower cost with a throughput decrease of at most 18.76%.</p></details> |  |

These privileges reduce the default isolation provided by containers and introduce significant security risks. Security risk identification for OT container deployments is challenged by hybrid IT/OT architectures, fragmented stakeholder knowledge, and continuous system changes. Existing approaches lack reproducibility, interpretability across contexts, and technical integration with deployment artefacts. We propose a model-based approach, implemented as the Container Security Risk Ontology (CSRO), which integrates five key domains: adversarial behaviour, contextual assumptions, attack scenarios, risk assessment rules, and container security artefacts. Our evaluation of CSRO in a case study demonstrates that the end-to-end formalisation of risk calculation, from artefact to risk level, enables automated and reproducible risk identification. While CSRO currently focuses on technical, container-level treatment measures, its modular and flexible design provides a solid foundation for extending the approach to host-level and organisational risk factors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication on the Software Engineering in Practice (SEIP) track of the Internation Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE'26)</p></details> |

However, existing Container-in-TEE designs (e.g., Confidential Containers (CoCo)) encapsulate the entire runtime within the TEE, inflating the trusted computing base (TCB) and introducing redundant components and cross-layer overhead. We present Arca, a lightweight confidential container framework based on a TEE-in-Container architecture that isolates each workload in an independent, hardware-enforced trust domain while keeping orchestration logic outside the TEE. This design minimizes inter-layer dependencies, confines compromise to per-container boundaries, and restores the TEE's minimal trust principle. We implemented Arca on Intel SGX, Intel TDX, and AMD SEV. Experimental results show that Arca achieves near-native performance and outperforms CoCo in most benchmarks, while the reduced TCB significantly improves verifiability and resilience against host-level compromise. Arca emonstrates that efficient container management and strong runtime confidentiality can be achieved without sacrificing security assurance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Squeezing Edge Performance: A Sensitivity-Aware Container Management for Heterogeneous Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23952v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Edge computing enables latency-critical applications to process data close to end devices, yet task heterogeneity and limited resources pose significant challenges to efficient orchestration. This paper presents a measurement-driven, container-based resource management framework for intra-node optimization on a single edge server hosting multiple heterogeneous applications. Extensive profiling experiments are conducted to derive a nonlinear fitting model that characterizes the relationship among CPU/memory allocations and processing latency across diverse workloads, enabling reliable estimation of performance under varying configurations and providing quantitative support for subsequent optimization. Using this model and a queueing-based delay formulation, we formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem to jointly minimize system latency and power consumption, which is shown to be NP-hard. The problem is decomposed into tractable convex subproblems and solved through a two-stage container-based resource management scheme (CRMS) combining convex optimization and greedy refinement. The proposed scheme achieves polynomial-time complexity and supports quasi-dynamic execution under global resource constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that CRMS reduces latency by over 14\% and improves energy efficiency compared with heuristic and search-based baselines, offering a practical and scalable solution for heterogeneous edge environments with dynamic workload characteristics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Derivatives for Containers in Univalent Foundations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17484v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Containers conveniently represent a wide class of inductive data types. Their derivatives compute representations of types of one-hole contexts, useful for implementing tree-traversal algorithms. In the category of containers and cartesian morphisms, derivatives of discrete containers (whose positions have decidable equality) satisfy a universal property. Working in Univalent Foundations, we extend the derivative operation to untruncated containers (whose shapes and positions are arbitrary types). We prove that this derivative, defined in terms of a set of isolated positions, satisfies an appropriate universal property in the wild category of untruncated containers and cartesian morphisms, as well as basic laws with respect to constants, sums and products. A chain rule exists, but is in general non-invertible. In fact, a globally invertible chain rule is inconsistent in the presence of non-set types, and equivalent to a classical principle when restricted to set-truncated containers. We derive a rule for derivatives of smallest fixed points from the chain rule, and characterize its invertibility. All of our results are formalized in Cubical Agda.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fix a...</summary><p>Fix an unfortunate copy-and-paste typo</p></details> |

Jenkins functions as a containerized controller with persistent volumes in the controller-light CI/CD framework presented in this paper, delegating difficult build and packaging tasks to a remote Docker host. The controller container maintains secure SSH connections to remote compute nodes while focusing solely on orchestration and reporting. Atomic deployments with time-stamped backups, containerized build environments, immutable artifact packaging, and automated notifications are all included in the system. Faster build throughput, reduced CPU and RAM consumption on the controller, and reduced artifact delivery latency are all revealed by experimental evaluation. For small and medium-sized DevOps businesses looking for scalable automation without adding orchestration complexity, this method offers a repeatable, low-maintenance solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: r...</summary><p>v2: revised writing and presentation; clarified contributions and experimental discussion</p></details> |

| **[Toward Optimal Approximations for Resource-Minimization for Fire Containment on Trees and Non-Uniform k-Center](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17049v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the most elementary spreading models on graphs can be described by a fire spreading from a burning vertex in discrete time steps. At each step, all neighbors of burning vertices catch fire. A well-studied extension to model fire containment is to allow for fireproofing a number $B$ of non-burning vertices at each step. Interestingly, basic computational questions about this model are computationally hard even on trees. One of the most prominent such examples is Resource Minimization for Fire Containment (RMFC), which asks how small $B$ can be chosen so that a given subset of vertices will never catch fire. Despite recent progress on RMFC on trees, prior work left a significant gap in terms of its approximability. We close this gap by providing an optimal $2$-approximation and an asymptotic PTAS, resolving two open questions in the literature. Both results are obtained in a unified way, by first designing a PTAS for a smooth variant of RMFC, which is obtained through a careful LP-guided enumeration procedure. Moreover, we show that our new techniques, with several additional ingredients, carry over to the non-uniform $k$-center problem (NUkC), by exploiting a link between RMFC on trees and NUkC established by Chakrabarty, Goyal, and Krishnaswamy. This leads to the first approximation algorithm for NUkC that is optimal in terms of the number of additional centers that have to be opened.</p></details> |  |

In the first variant $P$ and $Q$ are any simple polygons and the allowed transformations are translations only; in the second and third variants both polygons are convex and we allow either rotations only or any rigid motion. We also show that finding the translation in the plane that minimizes the Hausdorff distance between two segment sets is 3SUM-Hard.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appeared in SODA 1999, and IJCGA</p></details> |

Despite their popularity, major security concerns arise during container development and deployment. Software Engineering (SE) research literature reveals a lack of reviewed, aggregated, and organized knowledge of risks, vulnerabilities, security practices, and tools in container-based systems development and deployment. Therefore, we conducted a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) based on 129 selected primary studies to explore and organize existing knowledge on security issues in software container systems. Data from the primary studies enabled us to identify critical risks and vulnerabilities across the container life-cycle and categorize them using a novel taxonomy. Additionally, the findings highlight the causes and implications and provide a list of mitigation techniques to overcome these risks and vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we provide an aggregation of security practices and tools that can help support and improve the overall security of container systems. This study offers critical insights into the current landscape of security issues within software container systems. Our analysis highlights the need for future SE research to focus on security enhancement practices that strengthen container systems and develop effective mitigation strategies to comprehensively address existing risks and vulnerabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting the Containment Time of California Wildfires Using Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09835v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>California's wildfire season keeps getting worse over the years, overwhelming the emergency response teams. These fires cause massive destruction to both property and human life. Because of these reasons, there's a growing need for accurate and practical predictions that can help assist with resources allocation for the Wildfire managers or the response teams. In this research, we built machine learning models to predict the number of days it will require to fully contain a wildfire in California. Here, we addressed an important gap in the current literature. Most prior research has concentrated on wildfire risk or how fires spread, and the few that examine the duration typically predict it in broader categories rather than a continuous measure. This research treats the wildfire duration prediction as a regression task, which allows for more detailed and precise forecasts rather than just the broader categorical predictions used in prior work. We built the models by combining three publicly available datasets from California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection's Fire and Resource Assessment Program (FRAP). This study compared the performance of baseline ensemble regressor, Random Forest and XGBoost, with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The results show that the XGBoost model slightly outperforms the Random Forest model, likely due to its superior handling of static features in the dataset. The LSTM model, on the other hand, performed worse than the ensemble models because the dataset lacked temporal features. Overall, this study shows that, depending on the feature availability, Wildfire managers or Fire management authorities can select the most appropriate model to accurately predict wildfire containment duration and allocate resources effectively.</p></details> |  |

We show that the Bernoulli shift $[0,1]^Γ$ is infinitesimally contained in the left-regular action of $Γ$. For exact groups, this implies that sparse factor-of-iid subsets of $Γ$ are approximately hyperfinite. We use it to quantify a theorem of Chifan--Ioana on measured subrelations of the Bernoulli shift of an exact group. For the proof of infinitesimal containment we define \emph{entropy support maps}, which take a small subset $U$ of $\{0,1\}^I$ and assign weights to coordinates above every point of $U$, according to how ''important'' they are for the structure of the set.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 1 figure, comments welcome</p></details> |

This makes it difficult to specify container APIs that temporarily expose those pointers to the outside, and to verify programs that use these APIs. We present logical pinning, a lightweight borrowing model for sequential programs that allows users to selectively track container-internal pointers at the logical level. Our model generalizes the magic-wand operator for representing partial data structures, making it easy to write and prove precise specifications, including pointer-stability properties. Because it only changes the way representation predicates and specifications are written, our approach is compatible with most separation logic variants. We demonstrate the practicality of logical pinning by verifying small but representative pointer-manipulating programs, and deriving more precise versions of common container specifications. In doing so, we show that our approach subsumes some well-known proof patterns, simplifies some complex proofs, and enables reasoning about program patterns not supported by traditional specifications. All of our results are mechanized in the Rocq proof assistant, using the CFML library.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article will appear in CPP 2026</p></details> |

This article is a self-contained primer on diffusion over general state spaces, unifying continuous domains and discrete/categorical structures under one lens. We develop the discrete-time view (forward noising via Markov kernels and learned reverse dynamics) alongside its continuous-time limits -- stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) on finite alphabets -- and derive the associated Fokker--Planck and master equations. A common variational treatment yields the ELBO that underpins standard training losses. We make explicit how forward corruption choices -- Gaussian processes in continuous spaces and structured categorical transition kernels (uniform, masking/absorbing and more) in discrete spaces -- shape reverse dynamics and the ELBO. The presentation is layered for three audiences: newcomers seeking a self-contained intuitive introduction; diffusion practitioners wanting a global theoretical synthesis; and continuous-diffusion experts looking for an analogy-first path into discrete diffusion. The result is a unified roadmap to modern diffusion methodology across continuous domains and discrete sequences, highlighting a compact set of reusable proofs, identities, and core theoretical principles.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior approaches, BeaCon leverages dynamic analysis to simulate realistic environments, uncovering container execution paths that may remain hidden during the profiling phase. To address the challenge of exploring vast profiling spaces, we employ efficient heuristics to reveal additional system events with minimal effort. In addition, BeaCon incorporates a security and functionality scoring mechanism to prioritize system calls and capabilities based on their impact on the host OS kernel's security and the functionality of containerized applications. By integrating these scores, BeaCon achieves a customized balance between security and functionality, enabling cloud providers to enforce security measures while maintaining tenant availability. We implemented a prototype of BeaCon using eBPF kernel technology and conducted extensive evaluations. Results from the top 15 containers, which revealed significant improvements, demonstrate that BeaCon identifies an average of 16.5% additional syscalls by applying diverse environments. Furthermore, we evaluated its effectiveness in mitigating risks associated with 45 known vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs), showcasing its potential to significantly enhance container security. Additionally, we performed proof-of-concept demonstrations for two well-known security vulnerabilities, showing that BeaCon successfully reduces attack surface by blocking these exploits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive-Sensorless Monitoring of Shipping Containers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03022v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monitoring the internal temperature and humidity of shipping containers is essential to preventing quality degradation during cargo transportation. Sensorless monitoring -- machine learning models that predict the internal conditions of the containers using exogenous factors -- shows promise as an alternative to monitoring using sensors. However, it does not incorporate telemetry information and correct for systematic errors, causing the predictions to differ significantly from the live data and confusing the users. In this paper, we introduce the residual correction method, a general framework for correcting for systematic biases in sensorless models after observing live telemetry data. We call this class of models ``adaptive-sensorless'' monitoring. We train and evaluate adaptive-sensorless models on the 3.48 million data points -- the largest dataset of container sensor readings ever used in academic research -- and show that they produce consistent improvements over the baseline sensorless models. When evaluated on the holdout set of the simulated data, they achieve average mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 2.24 $\sim$ 2.31$^\circ$C (vs 2.43$^\circ$C by sensorless) for temperature and 5.72 $\sim$ 7.09% for relative humidity (vs 7.99% by sensorless) and average root mean-squared errors (RMSEs) of 3.19 $\sim$ 3.26$^\circ$C for temperature (vs 3.38$^\circ$C by sensorless) and 7.70 $\sim$ 9.12% for relative humidity (vs 10.0% by sensorless). Adaptive-sensorless models enable more accurate cargo monitoring, early risk detection, and less dependence on full connectivity in global shipping.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2025 IEEE Big Data</p></details> |

Existing approaches such as ray casting and generalized winding numbers often face limitations in robustness and computational efficiency. We propose a fast and numerically stable method for performing containment queries on trimmed surfaces, including those with periodic parameterizations. Our approach introduces a recursive winding number computation scheme that replaces costly curve subdivision with an ellipse-based bound for Bezier segments, enabling linear-time evaluation. For periodic surfaces, we lift trimming curves to the universal covering space, allowing accurate and consistent winding number computation even for non-contractible or discontinuous loops in parameter domain. Experiments show that our method achieves substantial speedups over existing winding-number algorithms while maintaining high robustness in the presence of geometric noise, open boundaries, and periodic topologies. We further demonstrate its effectiveness in processing real B-Rep models and in robust tessellation of trimmed surfaces.</p></details> |  |

Deploying microservice applications in the container-based cloud enables fine-grained elastic resource allocation. Autoscaling is an effective approach to dynamically adjust the resource provisioned to containers. However, the intricate microservice dependencies and the deployment scheme of the container-based cloud bring extra challenges of resource scaling. This article proposes a novel autoscaling approach named HGraphScale. In particular, HGraphScale captures microservice dependencies and the deployment scheme by a newly designed hierarchical graph neural network, and makes effective scaling actions for rapidly changing user requests workloads. Extensive experiments based on real-world traces of user requests are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of HGraphScale. The experiment results show that the HGraphScale outperforms existing state-of-the-art autoscaling approaches by reducing at most 80.16\% of the average response time under a certain VM rental budget of application providers.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate 20 IT-LLMs on modified MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks, by systematically varying the format of option labels (alphabetic, numeric, Roman) while keeping their meaning identical under four paradigms, namely: (1) With explicit instructions, label changes cause large performance shifts (e.g., -30.45\% for Roman vs. numeric), revealing instruction-format bias. (2) Without instructions, performance drops further (up to -10.84\%) and label sensitivity intensifies, underscoring the role of explicit guidance. (3) When option contents are removed, models fail random-choice baselines except with numeric labels, suggesting weak adherence to atomic directives. (4) Three-shot exemplars yield no significant gains in robustness or fidelity, and generation analyses show persistent label errors, especially for non-numeric formats. Across model sizes, larger LLMs achieve higher accuracy but remain inconsistent in instruction adherence. These results expose the insufficiencies of current instruction-tuning paradigms and highlight the need for evaluation methods and training strategies that explicitly target atomic instruction-following.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 1 figure, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[SBOMproof: Beyond Alleged SBOM Compliance for Supply Chain Security of Container Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05798v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supply chain security is extremely important for modern applications running at scale in the cloud. In fact, they involve a large number of heterogeneous microservices that also include third-party software. As a result, security vulnerabilities are hard to identify and mitigate before they start being actively exploited by attackers. For this reason, governments have recently introduced cybersecurity regulations that require vendors to share a software bill of material (SBOM) with end users or regulators. An SBOM can be employed to identify the security vulnerabilities of a software component even without access to its source code, as long as it is accurate and interoperable across different tools. This work evaluates this issue through a comprehensive study of tools for SBOM generation and vulnerability scanning, including both open-source software and cloud services from major providers. We specifically target software containers and focus on operating system packages in Linux distributions that are widely used as base images due to their far-reaching security impact. Our findings show that the considered tools are largely incompatible, leading to inaccurate reporting and a large amount of undetected vulnerabilities. We uncover the SBOM confusion vulnerability, a byproduct of such fragmented ecosystem, where inconsistent formats prevent reliable vulnerability detection across tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Carbon-Aware Container Orchestration: Predicting Workload Energy Consumption with Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03970v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing reliance on large-scale data centers to run resource-intensive workloads has significantly increased the global carbon footprint, underscoring the need for sustainable computing solutions. While container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes help optimize workload scheduling to reduce carbon emissions, existing methods often depend on centralized machine learning models that raise privacy concerns and struggle to generalize across diverse environments. In this paper, we propose a federated learning approach for energy consumption prediction that preserves data privacy by keeping sensitive operational data within individual enterprises. By extending the Kubernetes Efficient Power Level Exporter (Kepler), our framework trains XGBoost models collaboratively across distributed clients using Flower's FedXgbBagging aggregation using a bagging strategy, eliminating the need for centralized data sharing. Experimental results on the SPECPower benchmark dataset show that our FL-based approach achieves 11.7 percent lower Mean Absolute Error compared to a centralized baseline. This work addresses the unresolved trade-off between data privacy and energy prediction efficiency in prior systems such as Kepler and CASPER and offers enterprises a viable pathway toward sustainable cloud computing without compromising operational privacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 IEEE Smart World Congress (SWC 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Container Loading and Unloading through Dual-Cycling and Dockyard Rehandle Reduction Using a Hybrid Genetic Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08534v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the NP-hard problem of optimizing container handling at ports by integrating Quay Crane Dual-Cycling (QCDC) and dockyard rehandle minimization. We realized that there are interdependencies between the unloading sequence of QCDC and the dockyard plan and propose the Quay Crane Dual Cycle - Dockyard Rehandle Genetic Algorithm (QCDC-DR-GA), a hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) that holistically optimizes both aspects: maximizing the number of Dual Cycles (DCs) and minimizing the number of dockyard rehandles. QCDC-DR-GA employs specialized crossover and mutation strategies. Extensive experiments on various ship sizes demonstrate that QCDC-DR-GA reduces total operation time by 15-20% for large ships compared to existing methods. Statistical validation via two-tailed paired t-tests confirms significant improvements at a 5% significance level. The results underscore the inefficiency of isolated optimization and highlight the critical need for integrated algorithms in port operations. This approach increases resource utilization and operational efficiency, offering a cost-effective solution for ports to decrease turnaround times without infrastructure investments.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Benchmark Study of Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for the Container Stowage Planning Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02589v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Container stowage planning (CSPP) is a critical component of maritime transportation and terminal operations, directly affecting supply chain efficiency. Owing to its complexity, CSPP has traditionally relied on human expertise. While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been applied to CSPP, systematic benchmark comparisons across different algorithms remain limited. To address this gap, we develop a Gym environment that captures the fundamental features of CSPP and extend it to include crane scheduling in both multi-agent and single-agent formulations. Within this framework, we evaluate five RL algorithms: DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, and TRPO under multiple scenarios of varying complexity. The results reveal distinct performance gaps with increasing complexity, underscoring the importance of algorithm choice and problem formulation for CSPP. Overall, this paper benchmarks multiple RL methods for CSPP while providing a reusable Gym environment with crane scheduling, thus offering a foundation for future research and practical deployment in maritime logistics.</p></details> |  |
| **[gh0stEdit: Exploiting Layer-Based Access Vulnerability Within Docker Container Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08218v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Containerisation is a popular deployment process for application-level virtualisation using a layer-based approach. Docker is a leading provider of containerisation, and through the Docker Hub, users can supply Docker images for sharing and re-purposing popular software application containers. Using a combination of in-built inspection commands, publicly displayed image layer content, and static image scanning, Docker images are designed to ensure end users can clearly assess the content of the image before running them. In this paper we present gh0stEdit, an exploit that fundamentally undermines the integrity of Docker images and subverts the assumed trust and transparency they utilise. The use of gh0stEdit allows an attacker to maliciously edit Docker images, in a way that is not shown within the image history, hierarchy or commands. This attack can also be carried out against signed images (Docker Content Trust) without invalidating the image signature. We present a detailed case study for this exploit, and showcase how gh0stEdit is able to poison an image in a way that is not picked up through static or dynamic scanning tools. We highlight the issues in the current approach to Docker image security and trust, and expose an attack method which could potentially be exploited in the wild without being detected. To the best of our knowledge we are the first to provide detailed discussion on the exploit of this vulnerability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Direct Token Optimization: A Self-contained Approach to Large Language Model Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00125v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning is an emerging technique that removes the influence of a subset of training data (forget set) from a model without full retraining, with applications including privacy protection, content moderation, and model correction. The key challenge lies in ensuring that the model completely forgets the knowledge of the forget set without compromising its overall utility. Existing unlearning methods for large language models (LLMs) often utilize auxiliary language models, retain datasets, or even commercial AI services for effective unlearning and maintaining the model utility. However, dependence on these external resources is often impractical and could potentially introduce additional privacy risks. In this work, we propose direct token optimization (DTO), a novel self-contained unlearning approach for LLMs that directly optimizes the token level objectives and eliminates the need for external resources. Given a sequence to unlearn, we identify two categories of tokens: target tokens, which capture critical knowledge for unlearning, and the remaining non-target tokens, which are crucial for maintaining the model utility. The former are used to optimize the unlearning objective, while the latter serve to preserve the model's performance. The experimental results show that the proposed DTO achieves up to 16.8$\times$ improvement in forget quality on several benchmark datasets than the latest baselines while maintaining a comparable level of model utility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Monoid Structures on Indexed Containers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25879v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Containers represent a wide class of type constructions relevant for functional programming and (co)inductive reasoning. Indexed containers generalize this notion to better fit the scope of dependently typed programming. When interpreting types to be sets, a container describes an endofunctor on the category of sets while an I-indexed container describes an endofunctor on the category Set^I of I-indexed families of sets. We consider the monoidal structure on the category of I-indexed containers whose tensor product of containers describes the composition of the respective induced endofunctors. We then give a combinatorial characterization of monoids in this monoidal category, and we show how these monoids correspond precisely to monads on the induced endofunctors on Set^I. Lastly, we conclude by presenting some examples of monads on Set^I that fall under our characterization, including the product of two monads, indexed variants of the state and the writer monads and an example of a free monad. The technical results of this work are accompanied by a formalization in the proof assistant Cubical Agda.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings LSFA 2025, arXiv:2509.23739</p></details> |
| **[Resource Management Schemes for Cloud-Native Platforms with Computing Containers of Docker and Kubernetes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10350v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Businesses have made increasing adoption and incorporation of cloud technology into internal processes in the last decade. The cloud-based deployment provides on-demand availability without active management. More recently, the concept of cloud-native application has been proposed and represents an invaluable step toward helping organizations develop software faster and update it more frequently to achieve dramatic business outcomes. Cloud-native is an approach to build and run applications that exploit the cloud computing delivery model's advantages. It is more about how applications are created and deployed than where. The container-based virtualization technology, such as Docker and Kubernetes, serves as the foundation for cloud-native applications. This paper investigates the performance of two popular computational-intensive applications, big data, and deep learning, in a cloud-native environment. We analyze the system overhead and resource usage for these applications. Through extensive experiments, we show that the completion time reduces by up to 79.4% by changing the default setting and increases by up to 96.7% due to different resource management schemes on two platforms. Additionally, the resource release is delayed by up to 116.7% across different systems. Our work can guide developers, administrators, and researchers to better design and deploy their applications by selecting and configuring a hosting platform.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Parameterized Hardness of Zonotope Containment and Neural Network Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22849v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks with ReLU activations are a widely used model in machine learning. It is thus important to have a profound understanding of the properties of the functions computed by such networks. Recently, there has been increasing interest in the (parameterized) computational complexity of determining these properties. In this work, we close several gaps and resolve an open problem posted by Froese et al. [COLT '25] regarding the parameterized complexity of various problems related to network verification. In particular, we prove that deciding positivity (and thus surjectivity) of a function $f\colon\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$ computed by a 2-layer ReLU network is W[1]-hard when parameterized by $d$. This result also implies that zonotope (non-)containment is W[1]-hard with respect to $d$, a problem that is of independent interest in computational geometry, control theory, and robotics. Moreover, we show that approximating the maximum within any multiplicative factor in 2-layer ReLU networks, computing the $L_p$-Lipschitz constant for $p\in(0,\infty]$ in 2-layer networks, and approximating the $L_p$-Lipschitz constant in 3-layer networks are NP-hard and W[1]-hard with respect to $d$. Notably, our hardness results are the strongest known so far and imply that the naive enumeration-based methods for solving these fundamental problems are all essentially optimal under the Exponential Time Hypothesis.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |

To address the issues of distributed decisions in cloud-edge environments, we present TD3-Sched, a distributed reinforcement learning (DRL) scheduler based on Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) for continuous control of CPU and memory allocation, which can achieve optimized decisions for resource provisioning under dynamic workloads. On a realistic cloud-edge testbed with SockShop application and Alibaba traces, TD3-Sched achieves reductions of 17.9% to 38.6% in latency under same loads compared with other reinforcement-learning and rule-based baselines, and 16% to 31.6% under high loads. TD3-Sched also shows superior Service Level Objective (SLO) compliance with only 0.47% violations. These results indicate faster convergence, lower latency, and more stable performance while preserving service quality in container-based cloud-edge environment compared with the baselines.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

While cutting-edge methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excel in typical scenes, their performance deteriorates in the presence of mirrors. Existing solutions mainly focus on handling mirror surfaces through symmetry mapping but often overlook the rich information carried by mirror reflections. These reflections offer complementary perspectives that can fill in absent details and significantly enhance reconstruction quality. To advance 3D reconstruction in mirror-rich environments, we present MirrorScene3D, a comprehensive dataset featuring diverse indoor scenes, 1256 high-quality images, and annotated mirror masks, providing a benchmark for evaluating reconstruction methods in reflective settings. Building on this, we propose ReflectiveGS, an extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting that utilizes mirror reflections as complementary viewpoints rather than simple symmetry artifacts, enhancing scene geometry and recovering absent details. Experiments on MirrorScene3D show that ReflectiveGaussian outperforms existing methods in SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, and training speed, setting a new benchmark for 3D reconstruction in mirror-rich environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[XaaS Containers: Performance-Portable Representation With Source and IR Containers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17914v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-performance computing (HPC) systems and cloud data centers are converging, and containers are becoming the default method of portable software deployment. Yet, while containers simplify software management, they face significant performance challenges in HPC environments as they must sacrifice hardware-specific optimizations to achieve portability. Although HPC containers can use runtime hooks to access optimized MPI libraries and GPU devices, they are limited by application binary interface (ABI) compatibility and cannot overcome the effects of early-stage compilation decisions. Acceleration as a Service (XaaS) proposes a vision of performance-portable containers, where a containerized application should achieve peak performance across all HPC systems. We present a practical realization of this vision through Source and Intermediate Representation (IR) containers, where we delay performance-critical decisions until the target system specification is known. We analyze specialization mechanisms in HPC software and propose a new LLM-assisted method for automatic discovery of specializations. By examining the compilation pipeline, we develop a methodology to build containers optimized for target architectures at deployment time. Our prototype demonstrates that new XaaS containers combine the convenience of containerization with the performance benefits of system-specialized builds.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis (SC'25)</p></details> |
| **[A High-performance Real-time Container File Monitoring Approach Based on Virtual Machine Introspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16030v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As cloud computing continues to advance and become an integral part of modern IT infrastructure, container security has emerged as a critical factor in ensuring the smooth operation of cloud-native applications. An attacker can attack the service in the container or even perform the container escape attack by tampering with the files. Monitoring container files is important for APT detection and cyberspace security. Existing file monitoring methods are usually based on host operating system or virtual machine introspection to protect file security in real time. The methods based on the host operating system usually monitor file operations in the host operating system. However, when the container escapes to the host, the host operating system will no longer be secure, so these methods face the problem of weak security. Aiming at the problems of low security and high overload introduced in existing container file monitoring, a high-performance container file monitoring method based on virtual machine introspection is proposed. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively monitor the container files and introduce an acceptable monitoring overload.</p></details> |  |

We know that, for CQAC queries, the problem of testing containment is $Π_2 ^p$ -complete. However, there are broad classes of queries with semi-interval arithmetic comparisons in the containing query that render the problem solvable in NP. In all cases examined the contained query is allowed to be any CQAC. Interestingly, we also prove that there are simple cases where the problem remains $Π_2 ^p$ -complete. We also investigate the complexity of computing certain answers in the framework of answering CQAC queries with semi-interval comparisons using any CQAC views. We prove that maximally contained rewritings in the language of union of CQACs always compute exactly all certain answers. We find cases where we can compute certain answers in polynomial time using maximally contained rewritings.</p></details> | 71 pages 2 figures |
| **[Dstack: A Zero Trust Framework for Confidential Containers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11555v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Web3 applications require execution platforms that maintain confidentiality and integrity without relying on centralized trust authorities. While Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) offer promising capabilities for confidential computing, current implementations face significant limitations when applied to Web3 contexts, particularly in security reliability, censorship resistance, and vendor independence. This paper presents dstack, a comprehensive framework that transforms raw TEE technology into a true Zero Trust platform. We introduce three key innovations: (1) Portable Confidential Containers that enable seamless workload migration across heterogeneous TEE environments while maintaining security guarantees, (2) Decentralized Code Management that leverages smart contracts for transparent governance of TEE applications, and (3) Verifiable Domain Management that ensures secure and verifiable application identity without centralized authorities. These innovations are implemented through three core components: dstack-OS, dstack-KMS, and dstack-Gateway. Together, they demonstrate how to achieve both the performance advantages of VM-level TEE solutions and the trustless guarantees required by Web3 applications. Our evaluation shows that dstack provides comprehensive security guarantees while maintaining practical usability for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring and Exploiting the Resource Isolation Attack Surface of WebAssembly Containers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11242v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the WebAssembly (or Wasm) technology has been rapidly evolving, with many runtimes actively under development, providing cross-platform secure sandboxes for Wasm modules to run as portable containers. Compared with Docker, which isolates applications at the operating system level, Wasm runtimes provide more security mechanisms, such as linear memory, type checking, and protected call stacks. Although Wasm is designed with security in mind and considered to be a more secure container runtime, various security challenges have arisen, and researchers have focused on the security of Wasm runtimes, such as discovering vulnerabilities or proposing new security mechanisms to achieve robust isolation. However, we have observed that the resource isolation is not well protected by the current Wasm runtimes, and attackers can exhaust the host's resources to interfere with the execution of other container instances by exploiting the WASI/WASIX interfaces. And the attack surface has not been well explored and measured. In this paper, we explore the resource isolation attack surface of Wasm runtimes systematically by proposing several static Wasm runtime analysis approaches. Based on the analysis results, we propose several exploitation strategies to break the resource isolation of Wasm runtimes. The experimental results show that malicious Wasm instances can not only consume large amounts of system resources on their own but also introduce high workloads into other components of the underlying operating system, leading to a substantial performance degradation of the whole system. In addition, the mitigation approaches have also been discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 2 figures.

While improving the development and deployment of applications, this approach introduces security risks, particularly when outdated or vulnerable components are inadvertently included in production environments. Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is a critical process that helps identify and manage packages and dependencies inside a container. However, unintentional modifications to the container filesystem can lead to incomplete container images, which compromise the reliability of SCA tools. In this paper, we examine the limitations of both cloud-based and open-source SCA tools when faced with such obscure images. An analysis of 600 popular containers revealed that obscure containers exist in well-known registries and trusted images and that many tools fail to analyze such containers. To mitigate these issues, we propose an obscuration-resilient methodology for container analysis and introduce ORCA (Obscuration-Resilient Container Analyzer), its open-source implementation. We reported our findings to all vendors using their appropriate channels. Our results demonstrate that ORCA effectively detects the content of obscure containers and achieves a median 40% improvement in file coverage compared to Docker Scout and Syft.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unikernels vs. Containers: A Runtime-Level Performance Comparison for Resource-Constrained Edge Workloads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07891v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The choice between containers and unikernels is a critical trade-off for edge applications, balancing the container's ecosystem maturity against unikernel's specialized efficiency. However, until now, how this trade-off behaves under the severe memory constraints of industrial edge environments remains insufficiently investigated, especially across different execution models. This work presents an empirical comparison using Go and Node.js applications, representing ahead-of-time (AOT) and just-in-time (JIT) compilation, respectively. While unikernels consistently deliver faster startup times and outperform containers for Go-based workloads in resource-constrained environments, the evaluation results identify a critical performance crossover for Node.js. Below a certain memory threshold, Docker containers maintain stable performance for both I/O-bound and CPU-bound applications, while the Nanos unikernel's performance degrades sharply. This reveals that Linux's memory management capabilities can outweigh the minimalist efficiency of unikernels under resource scarcity, a critical trade-off that, until now, has not been adequately quantified for JIT runtimes in this context. These findings demonstrate that the optimal deployment paradigm depends on both runtime behavior and available system resources, underscoring the need for workload-aware deployment strategies in edge computing.</p></details> |  |

Verifying the correctness of such upgrades remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a verification-based approach to ensure the correctness of the existing functionality in the upgraded version of a PLC software. The method converts the older and the newer versions of the sequential function chart (SFC) into two Petri net models. We then verify whether one model is contained within another, based on a novel containment checking algorithm grounded in symbolic path equivalence. For this purpose, we have developed a home-grown Petri net-based containment checker. Experimental evaluation on 80 real-world benchmarks from the OSCAT library highlights the scalability and effectiveness of the framework. We have compared our approach with verifAPS, a popular tool used for software upgradation, and observed nearly 4x performance improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages with appendix</p></details> |

Containment is determined through the generalized winding number (GWN), a mathematical construction that is indifferent to the arrangement of surfaces in the shape. Applying contemporary techniques for the 3D GWN to trimmed NURBS surfaces requires some form of geometric discretization, introducing computational inefficiency to the algorithm and even risking containment misclassifications near the surface. In contrast, our proposed method uses a novel reformulation of the relevant surface integral based on Stokes' theorem, which operates on the boundary and trimming curves as provided through rapidly converging adaptive quadrature. Batches of queries are further accelerated by memoizing (i.e.\ caching and reusing) quadrature node positions and tangents as they are evaluated. We demonstrate that our GWN method is robust to complex trimming geometry in a CAD model, and is accurate up to arbitrary precision at arbitrary distances from the surface. The derived containment query is therefore robust to model non-watertightness while respecting all curved features of the input shape.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 Pa...</summary><p>18 Pages, 16 Figures, 1 Table</p></details> |

To enable the secure development, execution, and deployment, of applications on TEE platforms, TEE containers have been introduced as middleware solutions. These containers aim to shield applications from potentially malicious operating systems and orchestration interfaces while maintaining usability and reliability. In this paper, we analyze the isolation strategies employed by existing TEE containers to protect secure applications. To address the challenges in analyzing these interfaces, we designed an automated analyzer to precisely identify and evaluate their isolation boundaries. We observed that some TEE containers fail to achieve their intended goals due to critical design and implementation flaws, such as information leakage, rollback attacks, denial-of-service, and Iago attacks, which pose significant security risks. Drawing from our findings, we share key lessons to guide the development of more secure container solutions and discuss emerging trends in TEE containerization design.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional RL faces challenges when dealing with complex, real-world constraints, especially when action space feasibility is explicit and dependent on the corresponding state or trajectory. In this work, we address stochastic sequential dynamic decision-making problems with state-dependent constraints. As a relevant and real-world case study, we focus on the master stowage planning problem in container shipping, which aims to optimize revenue and operational costs under demand uncertainty and operational constraints. We propose a deep RL framework with an encoder-decoder model and feasibility layers that satisfy convex constraints and maintain unbiased gradient flow, which embed problem instances, current solutions, and demand uncertainty to guide learning. Experiments show that our model efficiently finds adaptive, feasible solutions that generalize across varying distributions and scale to larger instances, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in constrained RL and stochastic programming. By uniting artificial intelligence and operations research, our policy empowers humans to make adaptive, uncertainty-aware decisions for resilient and sustainable planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review</p></details> |

In the United States, shipping ports link the domestic economy to global markets and are vital to sustain supply chain flow and economic stability. Maritime shipping accounts for nearly half of the U.S.'s annual international trade, two thirds of which are represented by container shipping. Previous studies highlighted the capability of automation in enhancing container processing; however, unlike in European and East Asian ports, full automation is limited in U.S. ports due to legal protections for human labor. Consequently, there is a need for alternative methods that deliver automation level efficiencies while maintaining the terms of cooperative agreements. This paper proposes an Intelligent Planning System (IPS) that applies the concept of Pareto Optimization to container yards through a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) based recursive appointment system. The results show an improvement from baseline for both daily terminal throughput volumes and processing times. The generated IPS can be employed to provide recommendations for container positioning and truck pickup appointments to optimize container yard layout and flow resulting in reduced realtime congestion and predictively mitigated future congestion.</p></details> | 19 pages |
