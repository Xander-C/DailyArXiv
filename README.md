| **[A Fuzzy Logic-Based Cryptographic Framework For Real-Time Dynamic Key Generation For Enhanced Data Encryption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14132v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the ever-growing demand for cybersecurity, static key encryption mechanisms are increasingly vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to their deterministic and non-adaptive nature. Brute-force attacks, key compromise, and unauthorized access have become highly common cyber threats. This research presents a novel fuzzy logic-based cryptographic framework that dynamically generates encryption keys in real-time by accessing system-level entropy and hardware-bound trust. The proposed system leverages a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) to evaluate system parameters that include CPU utilization, process count, and timestamp variation. It assigns entropy level based on linguistically defined fuzzy rules which are fused with hardware-generated randomness and then securely sealed using a Trusted Platform Module (TPM). The sealed key is incorporated in an AES-GCM encryption scheme to ensure both confidentiality and integrity of the data. This system introduces a scalable solution for adaptive encryption in high-assurance computing, zero-trust environments, and cloud-based infrastructure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Linearly Homomorphic Ring Signature Scheme over Lattices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02281v3)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Homomorphic ring signature schemes combine the strong anonymity of ring signatures with the computability of homomorphic signatures, demonstrating significant potential in scenarios requiring both anonymous data provenance and verifiable homomorphic computation (e.g., confidential blockchain transactions and secure multi-party computation). However, no feasible homomorphic ring signature scheme currently exists. In this work, we propose the first lattice-based linearly homomorphic ring signature scheme. Proven secure in the standard model under the small integer solution (SIS) assumption, our scheme achieves strong anonymity under full key exposure and unforgeability against insider corruption attacks. As the first unified framework for ring signatures and linear homomorphic signatures, this construction provides a post-quantum-secure solution for the aforementioned applications, advancing the development of privacy-enhanced homomorphic computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Workflow for Full Traceability of AI Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11275v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An ever increasing number of high-stake decisions are made or assisted by automated systems employing brittle artificial intelligence technology. There is a substantial risk that some of these decision induce harm to people, by infringing their well-being or their fundamental human rights. The state-of-the-art in AI systems makes little effort with respect to appropriate documentation of the decision process. This obstructs the ability to trace what went into a decision, which in turn is a prerequisite to any attempt of reconstructing a responsibility chain. Specifically, such traceability is linked to a documentation that will stand up in court when determining the cause of some AI-based decision that inadvertently or intentionally violates the law. This paper takes a radical, yet practical, approach to this problem, by enforcing the documentation of each and every component that goes into the training or inference of an automated decision. As such, it presents the first running workflow supporting the generation of tamper-proof, verifiable and exhaustive traces of AI decisions. In doing so, we expand the DBOM concept into an effective running workflow leveraging confidential computing technology. We demonstrate the inner workings of the workflow in the development of an app to tell poisonous and edible mushrooms apart, meant as a playful example of high-stake decision support.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |
| **[zkSTAR: A zero knowledge system for time series attack detection enforcing regulatory compliance in critical infrastructure networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23060v2)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial control systems (ICS) form the operational backbone of critical infrastructure networks (CIN) such as power grids, water supply systems, and gas pipelines. As cyber threats to these systems escalate, regulatory agencies are imposing stricter compliance requirements to ensure system-wide security and reliability. A central challenge, however, is enabling regulators to verify the effectiveness of detection mechanisms without requiring utilities to disclose sensitive operational data. In this paper, we introduce zkSTAR, a cyberattack detection framework that leverages zk-SNARKs to reconcile these requirements and enable provable detection guarantees while preserving data confidentiality. Our approach builds on established residual-based statistical hypothesis testing methods applied to state-space detection models. Specifically, we design a two-pronged zk-SNARK architecture that enforces (i) temporal consistency of the state-space dynamics and (ii) statistical consistency of the detection tests, enabling regulators to verify correctness and prevent suppression of alarms without visibility into utility-level data. We formally analyze the soundness and zero-knowledge properties of our framework and validate its practical feasibility through computational experiments on real-world ICS datasets. As a result, our work demonstrates a scalable, privacy-preserving alternative for regulatory compliance for ICS driven critical infrastructure networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Securing Generative AI in Healthcare: A Zero-Trust Architecture Powered by Confidential Computing on Google Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11836v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in healthcare is impeded by significant security challenges unaddressed by traditional frameworks, precisely the data-in-use gap where sensitive patient data and proprietary AI models are exposed during active processing. To address this, the paper proposes the Confidential Zero-Trust Framework (CZF), a novel security paradigm that synergistically combines Zero-Trust Architecture for granular access control with the hardware-enforced data isolation of Confidential Computing. We detailed a multi-tiered architectural blueprint for implementing the CZF on Google Cloud and analyzed its efficacy against real-world threats. The CZF provides a defense-in-depth architecture where data remains encrypted while in-use within a hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). The framework's use of remote attestation offers cryptographic proof of workload integrity, transforming compliance from a procedural exercise into a verifiable technical fact and enabling secure, multi-party collaborations previously blocked by security and intellectual property concerns. By closing the data-in-use gap and enforcing Zero-Trust principles, the CZF provides a robust and verifiable framework that establishes the necessary foundation of trust to enable the responsible adoption of transformative AI technologies in healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 Pa...</summary><p>19 Pages, 1 Figure, 1 Table</p></details> |
| **[Experiences Building Enterprise-Level Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning to Power AI for Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08998v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach to enabling collaborative model training without centralized data sharing, a crucial requirement in scientific domains where data privacy, ownership, and compliance constraints are critical. However, building user-friendly enterprise-level FL frameworks that are both scalable and privacy-preserving remains challenging, especially when bridging the gap between local prototyping and distributed deployment across heterogeneous client computing infrastructures. In this paper, based on our experiences building the Advanced Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (APPFL) framework, we present our vision for an enterprise-grade, privacy-preserving FL framework designed to scale seamlessly across computing environments. We identify several key capabilities that such a framework must provide: (1) Scalable local simulation and prototyping to accelerate experimentation and algorithm design; (2) seamless transition from simulation to deployment; (3) distributed deployment across diverse, real-world infrastructures, from personal devices to cloud clusters and HPC systems; (4) multi-level abstractions that balance ease of use and research flexibility; and (5) comprehensive privacy and security through techniques such as differential privacy, secure aggregation, robust authentication, and confidential computing. We further discuss architectural designs to realize these goals. This framework aims to bridge the gap between research prototypes and enterprise-scale deployment, enabling scalable, reliable, and privacy-preserving AI for science.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Beginner's Textbook for Fully Homomorphic Encryption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05136v18)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a cryptographic scheme that enables computations to be performed directly on encrypted data, as if the data were in plaintext. After all computations are performed on the encrypted data, it can be decrypted to reveal the result. The decrypted value matches the result that would have been obtained if the same computations were applied to the plaintext data. FHE supports basic operations such as addition and multiplication on encrypted numbers. Using these fundamental operations, more complex computations can be constructed, including subtraction, division, logic gates (e.g., AND, OR, XOR, NAND, MUX), and even advanced mathematical functions such as ReLU, sigmoid, and trigonometric functions (e.g., sin, cos). These functions can be implemented either as exact formulas or as approximations, depending on the trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy. FHE enables privacy-preserving machine learning by allowing a server to process the client's data in its encrypted form through an ML model. With FHE, the server learns neither the plaintext version of the input features nor the inference results. Only the client, using their secret key, can decrypt and access the results at the end of the service protocol. FHE can also be applied to confidential blockchain services, ensuring that sensitive data in smart contracts remains encrypted and confidential while maintaining the transparency and integrity of the execution process. Other applications of FHE include secure outsourcing of data analytics, encrypted database queries, privacy-preserving searches, efficient multi-party computation for digital signatures, and more. As this book is an open project (https://fhetextbook.github.io), we welcome FHE experts to join us as collaborators to help expand the draft.</p></details> |  |
| **[Confidentiality in a Card-Based Protocol Under Repeated Biased Shuffles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05111v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we provide a probabilistic analysis of the confidentiality in a card-based protocol. We focus on Bert den Boer's original Five Card Trick to develop our approach. Five Card Trick was formulated as a secure two-party computation method, where two players use colored cards with identical backs to calculate the logical AND operation on the bits that they choose. In this method, the players first arrange the cards privately, and then shuffle them through a random cut. Finally, they reveal the shuffled arrangement to determine the result of the operation. An unbiased random cut is essential to prevent players from exposing their chosen bits to each other. However, players typically choose to move cards within the deck even though not moving any cards should be equally likely. This unconscious behavior results in a biased, nonuniform shuffling-distribution in the sense that some arrangements of cards are slightly more probable after the cut. Such a nonuniform distribution creates an opportunity for a malicious player to gain advantage in guessing the other player's choice. We provide the conditional probabilities of such guesses as a way to quantify the information leakage. Furthermore, we utilize the eigenstructure of a Markov chain to derive tight bounds on the number of times the biased random cuts must be repeated to reduce the leakage to an acceptable level. We also discuss the generalization of our approach to the setting where shuffling is conducted by a malicious player.</p></details> | 17 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Confidential Computing for Cloud Security: Exploring Hardware based Encryption Using Trusted Execution Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04550v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growth of cloud computing has revolutionized data processing and storage capacities to another levels of scalability and flexibility. But in the process, it has created a huge challenge of security, especially in terms of safeguarding sensitive data. Classical security practices, including encryption at rest and during transit, fail to protect data in use and expose it to various possible breaches. In response to this problem , Confidential Computing has been a tool ,seeking to secure data in processing by usage of hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). TEEs, including Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX) and ARM's TrustZone, offers protected contexts within the processor, where data is kept confidential ,intact and secure , even with malicious software or compromised operating systems. In this research, we have explored the architecture and security features of TEEs like Intel SGX and ARM TrustZone, and their effectiveness in improving cloud data security. From a thorough literature survey ,we have analyzed the deployment strategies, performance indicators, and practical uses of these TEEs for the same purpose. In addition, we have discussed the issues regarding deployment, possible weaknesses, scalability issues, and integration issues. Our results focuses on the central position of TEEs in strengthening and advancing cloud security infrastructures, pointing towards their ability to create a secure foundation for Confidential Computing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interval Estimation for Binomial Proportions Under Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02227v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When releasing binary proportions computed using sensitive data, several government agencies and other data stewards protect confidentiality of the underlying values by ensuring the released statistics satisfy differential privacy. Typically, this is done by adding carefully chosen noise to the sample proportion computed using the confidential data. In this article, we describe and compare methods for turning this differentially private proportion into an interval estimate for an underlying population probability. Specifically, we consider differentially private versions of the Wald and Wilson intervals, Bayesian credible intervals based on denoising the differentially private proportion, and an exact interval motivated by the Clopper-Pearson confidence interval. We examine the repeated sampling performances of the intervals using simulation studies under both the Laplace mechanism and discrete Gaussian mechanism across a range of privacy guarantees. We find that while several methods can offer reasonable performances, the Bayesian credible intervals are the most attractive.</p></details> |  |
| **[Security Audit of intel ICE Driver for e810 Network Interface Card](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01910v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The security of enterprise-grade networking hardware and software is critical to ensuring the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of data in modern cloud and data center environments. Network interface controllers (NICs) play a pivotal role in high-performance computing and virtualization, but their privileged access to system resources makes them a prime target for security vulnerabilities. This study presents a security analysis of the Intel ICE driver using the E810 Ethernet Controller, employing static analysis, fuzz testing, and timing-based side-channel evaluation to assess robustness against exploitation. The objective is to evaluate the drivers resilience to malformed inputs, identify implementation weaknesses, and determine whether timing discrepancies can be exploited for unauthorized inference of system states. Static code analysis reveals that insufficient bounds checking and unsafe string operations may introduce security flaws. Fuzz testing targets the Admin Queue, debugfs interface, and virtual function (VF) management. Interface-aware fuzzing and command mutation confirm strong input validation that prevents memory corruption and privilege escalation under normal conditions. However, using principles from KernelSnitch, the driver is found to be susceptible to timing-based side-channel attacks. Execution time discrepancies in hash table lookups allow an unprivileged attacker to infer VF occupancy states, enabling potential network mapping in multi-tenant environments. Further analysis shows inefficiencies in Read-Copy-Update (RCU) synchronization, where missing synchronization leads to stale data persistence, memory leaks, and out-of-memory conditions. Kernel instrumentation confirms that occupied VF lookups complete faster than unoccupied queries, exposing timing-based information leakage.</p></details> | <details><summary>Final...</summary><p>Final Year Project Report, submitted 24/03/2025 as part of Bachelor of Science in Cyber Security and IT Forensics at the University Of Limerick</p></details> |
| **[Security and Privacy Management of IoT Using Quantum Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03538v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The convergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and quantum computing is redefining the security paradigm of interconnected digital systems. Classical cryptographic algorithms such as RSA, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) have long provided the foundation for securing IoT communication. However, the emergence of quantum algorithms such as Shor's and Grover's threatens to render these techniques vulnerable, necessitating the development of quantum-resilient alternatives. This chapter examines the implications of quantum computing for IoT security and explores strategies for building cryptographically robust systems in the post-quantum era. It presents an overview of Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC) families, including lattice-based, code-based, hash-based, and multivariate approaches, analyzing their potential for deployment in resource-constrained IoT environments. In addition, quantum-based methods such as Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNGs) are discussed for their ability to enhance confidentiality and privacy through physics-based security guarantees. The chapter also highlights issues of privacy management, regulatory compliance, and standardization, emphasizing the need for collaborative efforts across academia, industry, and governance. Overall, it provides a comprehensive perspective on security IoT ecosystems against quantum threats and ensures resilience in the next generation of intelligent networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint of the chapter.

| **[Confidential FRIT via Homomorphic Encryption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26179v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Edge computing alleviates the computation burden of data-driven control in cyber-physical systems (CPSs) by offloading complex processing to edge servers. However, the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks underscores the need for security measures that go beyond conventional IT protections and address the unique vulnerabilities of CPSs. This study proposes a confidential data-driven gain-tuning framework using homomorphic encryption, such as ElGamal and CKKS encryption schemes, to enhance cybersecurity in gain-tuning processes outsourced to external servers. The idea for realizing confidential FRIT is to replace the matrix inversion operation with a vector summation form, allowing homomorphic operations to be applied. Numerical examples under 128-bit security confirm performance comparable to conventional methods while providing guidelines for selecting suitable encryption schemes for secure CPS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Design and Optimization of Cloud Native Homomorphic Encryption Workflows for Privacy-Preserving ML Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24498v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As machine learning (ML) models become increasingly deployed through cloud infrastructures, the confidentiality of user data during inference poses a significant security challenge. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) has emerged as a compelling cryptographic technique that enables computation on encrypted data, allowing predictions to be generated without decrypting sensitive inputs. However, the integration of HE within large scale cloud native pipelines remains constrained by high computational overhead, orchestration complexity, and model compatibility issues. This paper presents a systematic framework for the design and optimization of cloud native homomorphic encryption workflows that support privacy-preserving ML inference. The proposed architecture integrates containerized HE modules with Kubernetes-based orchestration, enabling elastic scaling and parallel encrypted computation across distributed environments. Furthermore, optimization strategies including ciphertext packing, polynomial modulus adjustment, and operator fusion are employed to minimize latency and resource consumption while preserving cryptographic integrity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves up to 3.2times inference acceleration and 40% reduction in memory utilization compared to conventional HE pipelines. These findings illustrate a practical pathway for deploying secure ML-as-a-Service (MLaaS) systems that guarantee data confidentiality under zero-trust cloud conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages 2 figures, 2 tABLES</p></details> |
| **[Secure and Confidential Certificates of Online Fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02777v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The black-box service model enables ML service providers to serve clients while keeping their intellectual property and client data confidential. Confidentiality is critical for delivering ML services legally and responsibly, but makes it difficult for outside parties to verify important model properties such as fairness. Existing methods that assess model fairness confidentially lack either (i) reliability because they certify fairness with respect to a static set of data, and therefore fail to guarantee fairness in the presence of distribution shift or service provider malfeasance; and/or (ii) scalability due to the computational overhead of confidentiality-preserving cryptographic primitives. We address these problems by introducing online fairness certificates, which verify that a model is fair with respect to data received by the service provider online during deployment. We then present OATH, a deployably efficient and scalable zero-knowledge proof protocol for confidential online group fairness certification. OATH exploits statistical properties of group fairness via a cut-and-choose style protocol, enabling scalability improvements over baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward provably private analytics and insights into GenAI use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21684v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale systems that compute analytics over a fleet of devices must achieve high privacy and security standards while also meeting data quality, usability, and resource efficiency expectations. We present a next-generation federated analytics system that uses Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) based on technologies like AMD SEV-SNP and Intel TDX to provide verifiable privacy guarantees for all server-side processing. In our system, devices encrypt and upload data, tagging it with a limited set of allowable server-side processing steps. An open source, TEE-hosted key management service guarantees that the data is accessible only to those steps, which are themselves protected by TEE confidentiality and integrity assurance guarantees. The system is designed for flexible workloads, including processing unstructured data with LLMs (for structured summarization) before aggregation into differentially private insights (with automatic parameter tuning). The transparency properties of our system allow any external party to verify that all raw and derived data is processed in TEEs, protecting it from inspection by the system operator, and that differential privacy is applied to all released results. This system has been successfully deployed in production, providing helpful insights into real-world GenAI experiences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Secure Multi-Key Homomorphic Encryption with Application to Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20101v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Key Homomorphic Encryption (MKHE), proposed by Lopez-Alt et al. (STOC 2012), allows for performing arithmetic computations directly on ciphertexts encrypted under distinct keys. Subsequent works by Chen and Dai et al. (CCS 2019) and Kim and Song et al. (CCS 2023) extended this concept by proposing multi-key BFV/CKKS variants, referred to as the CDKS scheme. These variants incorporate asymptotically optimal techniques to facilitate secure computation across multiple data providers. In this paper, we identify a critical security vulnerability in the CDKS scheme when applied to multiparty secure computation tasks, such as privacy-preserving federated learning (PPFL). In particular, we show that CDKS may inadvertently leak plaintext information from one party to others. To mitigate this issue, we propose a new scheme, SMHE (Secure Multi-Key Homomorphic Encryption), which incorporates a novel masking mechanism into the multi-key BFV and CKKS frameworks to ensure that plaintexts remain confidential throughout the computation. We implement a PPFL application using SMHE and demonstrate that it provides significantly improved security with only a modest overhead in homomorphic evaluation. For instance, our PPFL model based on multi-key CKKS incurs less than a 2\times runtime and communication traffic increase compared to the CDKS-based PPFL model. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/JiahuiWu2022/SMHE.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[zk-Agreements: A Privacy-Preserving Way to Establish Deterministic Trust in Confidential Agreements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20007v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital transactions currently exceed trillions of dollars annually, yet traditional paper-based agreements remain a bottleneck for automation, enforceability, and dispute resolution. Natural language contracts introduce ambiguity, require manual processing, and lack computational verifiability, all of which hinder efficient digital commerce. Computable legal contracts, expressed in machine-readable formats, offer a potential solution by enabling automated execution and verification. Blockchain-based smart contracts further strengthen enforceability and accelerate dispute resolution; however, current implementations risk exposing sensitive agreement terms on public ledgers, raising serious privacy and competitive intelligence concerns that limit enterprise adoption. We introduce zk-agreements, a protocol designed to transition from paper-based trust to cryptographic trust while preserving confidentiality. Our design combines zero-knowledge proofs to protect private agreement terms, secure two-party computation to enable private compliance evaluation, and smart contracts to guarantee automated enforcement. Together, these components achieve both privacy preservation and computational enforceability, resolving the fundamental tension between transparency and confidentiality in blockchain-based agreements.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Financial Cryptography 2026 if accepted</p></details> |
| **[QORE : Quantum Secure 5G/B5G Core](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19982v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing is reshaping the security landscape of modern telecommunications. The cryptographic foundations that secure todays 5G systems, including RSA, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), and Diffie-Hellman (DH), are all susceptible to attacks enabled by Shors algorithm. Protecting 5G networks against future quantum adversaries has therefore become an urgent engineering and research priority. In this paper we introduce QORE, a quantum-secure 5G and Beyond 5G (B5G) Core framework that provides a clear pathway for transitioning both the 5G Core Network Functions and User Equipment (UE) to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). The framework uses the NIST-standardized lattice-based algorithms Module-Lattice Key Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM) and Module-Lattice Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA) and applies them across the 5G Service-Based Architecture (SBA). A Hybrid PQC (HPQC) configuration is also proposed, combining classical and quantum-safe primitives to maintain interoperability during migration. Experimental validation shows that ML-KEM achieves quantum security with minor performance overhead, meeting the low-latency and high-throughput requirements of carrier-grade 5G systems. The proposed roadmap aligns with ongoing 3GPP SA3 and SA5 study activities on the security and management of post-quantum networks as well as with NIST PQC standardization efforts, providing practical guidance for mitigating quantum-era risks while safeguarding long-term confidentiality and integrity of network data.</p></details> | 23 pages |
| **[Cross-Chain Sealed-Bid Auctions Using Confidential Compute Blockchains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19491v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sealed-bid auctions ensure fair competition and efficient allocation but are often deployed on centralized infrastructure, enabling opaque manipulation. Public blockchains eliminate central control, yet their inherent transparency conflicts with the confidentiality required for sealed bidding. Prior attempts struggle to reconcile privacy, verifiability, and scalability without relying on trusted intermediaries, multi-round protocols, or expensive cryptography. We present a sealed-bid auction protocol that executes sensitive bidding logic on a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)-backed confidential compute blockchain while retaining settlement and enforcement on a public chain. Bidders commit funds to enclave-generated escrow addresses, ensuring confidentiality and binding commitments. After the deadline, any party can trigger resolution: the confidential blockchain determines the winner through verifiable off-chain computation and issues signed settlement transactions for execution on the public chain. Our design provides security, privacy, and scalability without trusted third parties or protocol modifications. We implement it on SUAVE with Ethereum settlement, evaluate its scalability and trust assumptions, and demonstrate deployment with minimal integration on existing infrastructure</p></details> |  |
| **[sNVMe-oF: Secure and Efficient Disaggregated Storage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18756v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disaggregated storage with NVMe-over-Fabrics (NVMe-oF) has emerged as the standard solution in modern data centers, achieving superior performance, resource utilization, and power efficiency. Simultaneously, confidential computing (CC) is becoming the de facto security paradigm, enforcing stronger isolation and protection for sensitive workloads. However, securing state-of-the-art storage with traditional CC methods struggles to scale and compromises performance or security. To address these issues, we introduce sNVMe-oF, a storage management system extending the NVMe-oF protocol and adhering to the CC threat model by providing confidentiality, integrity, and freshness guarantees. sNVMe-oF offers an appropriate control path and novel concepts such as counter-leasing. sNVMe-oF also optimizes data path performance by leveraging NVMe metadata, introducing a new disaggregated Hazel Merkle Tree (HMT), and avoiding redundant IPSec protections. We achieve this without modifying the NVMe-oF protocol. To prevent excessive resource usage while delivering line rate, sNVMe-oF also uses accelerators of CC-capable smart NICs. We prototype sNVMe-oF on an NVIDIA BlueField-3 and demonstrate how it can achieve as little as 2% performance degradation for synthetic patterns and AI training.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Early Bird Catches the Leak: Unveiling Timing Side Channels in LLM Serving Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20002v5)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The wide deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to strong demands for optimizing their inference performance. Today's techniques serving this purpose primarily focus on reducing latency and improving throughput through algorithmic and hardware enhancements, while largely overlooking their privacy side effects, particularly in a multi-user environment. In our research, for the first time, we discovered a set of new timing side channels in LLM systems, arising from shared caches and GPU memory allocations, which can be exploited to infer both confidential system prompts and those issued by other users. These vulnerabilities echo security challenges observed in traditional computing systems, highlighting an urgent need to address potential information leakage in LLM serving infrastructures. In this paper, we report novel attack strategies designed to exploit such timing side channels inherent in LLM deployments, specifically targeting the Key-Value (KV) cache and semantic cache widely used to enhance LLM inference performance. Our approach leverages timing measurements and classification models to detect cache hits, allowing an adversary to infer private prompts with high accuracy. We also propose a token-by-token search algorithm to efficiently recover shared prompt prefixes in the caches, showing the feasibility of stealing system prompts and those produced by peer users. Our experimental studies on black-box testing of popular online LLM services demonstrate that such privacy risks are completely realistic, with significant consequences. Our findings underscore the need for robust mitigation to protect LLM systems against such emerging threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was first submitted for review on Sept. 5, 2024, and the initial version was uploaded to Arxiv on Sept. 30, 2024.

| **[FedHFT: Efficient Federated Finetuning with Heterogeneous Edge Clients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14054v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has become a common practice for personalized natural language understanding (NLU) applications on downstream tasks and domain-specific datasets. However, there are two main challenges: (i) limited and/or heterogeneous data for fine-tuning due to proprietary data confidentiality or privacy requirements, and (ii) varying computation resources available across participating clients such as edge devices. This paper presents FedHFT - an efficient and personalized federated fine-tuning framework to address both challenges. First, we introduce a mixture of masked adapters to handle resource heterogeneity across participating clients, enabling high-performance collaborative fine-tuning of pre-trained language model(s) across multiple clients in a distributed setting, while keeping proprietary data local. Second, we introduce a bi-level optimization approach to handle non-iid data distribution based on masked personalization and client clustering. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant performance and efficiency improvements over various natural language understanding tasks under data and resource heterogeneity compared to representative heterogeneous federated learning methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[PrivTuner with Homomorphic Encryption and LoRA: A P3EFT Scheme for Privacy-Preserving Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of AI Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00433v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI foundation models have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks. Fine-tuning (FT) is a method of customizing a pre-trained AI foundation model by further training it on a smaller, targeted dataset. In this paper, we initiate the study of the Privacy-Preserving Parameter-Efficient FT (P3EFT) framework, which can be viewed as the intersection of Parameter-Efficient FT (PEFT) and Privacy-Preserving FT (PPFT). PEFT modifies only a small subset of the model's parameters to achieve FT (i.e., adapting a pre-trained model to a specific dataset), while PPFT uses privacy-preserving technologies to protect the confidentiality of the model during the FT process. There have been many studies on PEFT or PPFT but very few on their fusion, which motivates our work on P3EFT to achieve both parameter efficiency and model privacy. To exemplify our P3EFT, we present the PrivTuner scheme, which incorporates Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enabled privacy protection into LoRA (short for ``Low-Rank Adapter''). Intuitively speaking, PrivTuner allows the model owner and the external data owners to collaboratively implement PEFT with encrypted data. After describing PrivTuner in detail, we further investigate its energy consumption and privacy protection. Then, we consider a PrivTuner system over wireless communications and formulate a joint optimization problem to adaptively minimize energy while maximizing privacy protection, with the optimization variables including FDMA bandwidth allocation, wireless transmission power, computational resource allocation, and privacy protection. A resource allocation algorithm is devised to solve the problem. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm can significantly reduce energy consumption while adapting to different privacy requirements.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a novel binary verification service, AGORA, scrupulously designed to overcome the challenge. At the heart of this approach lies a strategic insight: certain tasks can be delegated to untrusted entities, while the corresponding validators are securely housed within the trusted computing base (TCB). AGORA can validate untrusted assertions generated for versatile policies. Through a novel blockchain-based bounty task manager, it also utilizes crowdsourcing to remove trust in theorem provers. These synergistic techniques successfully ameliorate the TCB size burden associated with two procedures: binary analysis and theorem proving. The design of AGORA allows untrusted parties to participate in these complex processes. Moreover, based on running the optimized TCB within trusted execution environments and recording the verification process on a blockchain, the public can audit the correctness of verification results. By implementing verification workflows for software-based fault isolation policy and side-channel mitigation, our evaluation demonstrates the efficacy of AGORA.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in OOPSLA 2025</p></details> |

This integration enhances the efficiency, safety, and sustainability of transportation systems. TCPS rely heavily on cryptographic security to protect sensitive information transmitted between vehicles, transportation infrastructure, and other entities within the transportation ecosystem, ensuring data integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity. Traditional cryptographic methods have been employed to secure TCPS communications, but the advent of quantum computing presents a significant threat to these existing security measures. Therefore, integrating Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) into TCPS is essential to maintain secure and resilient communications. While PQC offers a promising approach to developing cryptographic algorithms resistant to quantum attacks, artificial intelligence (AI) can enhance PQC by optimizing algorithm selection, resource allocation, and adapting to evolving threats in real-time. AI-driven PQC approaches can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of PQC implementations, ensuring robust security without compromising system performance. This chapter introduces TCPS communication protocols, discusses the vulnerabilities of corresponding communications to cyber-attacks, and explores the limitations of existing cryptographic methods in the quantum era. By examining how AI can strengthen PQC solutions, the chapter presents cyber-resilient communication strategies for TCPS.</p></details> |  |

Privacy-preserving Machine Learning (PPML) addresses this challenge by enabling inference on private data without revealing sensitive inputs or proprietary models. Leveraging Secure Computation techniques from Cryptography, two widely studied approaches in this domain are Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Garbled Circuits (GC). This work presents a comparative evaluation of FHE and GC for secure neural network inference. A two-layer neural network (NN) was implemented using the CKKS scheme from the Microsoft SEAL library (FHE) and the TinyGarble2.0 framework (GC) by IntelLabs. Both implementations are evaluated under the semi-honest threat model, measuring inference output error, round-trip time, peak memory usage, communication overhead, and communication rounds. Results reveal a trade-off: modular GC offers faster execution and lower memory consumption, while FHE supports non-interactive inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables, 32 references</p></details> |

A well-known problem encountered in this setting is the so-called catastrophic forgetting, for which the learning model is inclined to focus on more recent tasks while forgetting the previously learned knowledge. The majority of the current approaches in FCL propose generative-based solutions to solve said problem. However, this setting requires multiple training epochs over the data, implying an offline setting where datasets are stored locally and remain unchanged over time. Furthermore, the proposed solutions are tailored for vision tasks solely. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new approach to deal with different modalities in the online scenario where new data arrive in streams of mini-batches that can only be processed once. To solve catastrophic forgetting, we propose an uncertainty-aware memory-based approach. Specifically, we suggest using an estimator based on the Bregman Information (BI) to compute the model's variance at the sample level. Through measures of predictive uncertainty, we retrieve samples with specific characteristics, and - by retraining the model on such samples - we demonstrate the potential of this approach to reduce the forgetting effect in realistic settings while maintaining data confidentiality and competitive communication efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025: https://openreview.net/forum?id=f65RuQgVlp</p></details> |

Homomorphic Encryption (HE) has emerged as a promising solution to this problems, allowing computations on encrypted data without decryption. Despite its potential, existing approaches to integrate HE into neural networks are often limited to specific architectures, leaving a wide gap in providing a framework for easy development of HE-friendly privacy-preserving neural network models similar to what we have in the broader field of machine learning. In this paper, we present FHEON, a configurable framework for developing privacy-preserving convolutional neural network (CNN) models for inference using HE. FHEON introduces optimized and configurable implementations of privacy-preserving CNN layers including convolutional layers, average pooling layers, ReLU activation functions, and fully connected layers. These layers are configured using parameters like input channels, output channels, kernel size, stride, and padding to support arbitrary CNN architectures. We assess the performance of FHEON using several CNN architectures, including LeNet-5, VGG-11, VGG- 16, ResNet-20, and ResNet-34. FHEON maintains encrypted-domain accuracies within +/- 1% of their plaintext counterparts for ResNet-20 and LeNet-5 models. Notably, on a consumer-grade CPU, the models build on FHEON achieved 98.5% accuracy with a latency of 13 seconds on MNIST using LeNet-5, and 92.2% accuracy with a latency of 403 seconds on CIFAR-10 using ResNet-20. Additionally, FHEON operates within a practical memory budget requiring not more than 42.3 GB for VGG-16.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |
| **[PrivSpike: Employing Homomorphic Encryption for Private Inference of Deep Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03995v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has become a cornerstone of modern machine learning. It relies heavily on vast datasets and significant computational resources for high performance. This data often contains sensitive information, making privacy a major concern in deep learning. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient alternative to conventional deep learning approaches. Nevertheless, SNNs still depend on large volumes of data, inheriting all the privacy challenges of deep learning. Homomorphic encryption addresses this challenge by allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data, ensuring data confidentiality throughout the entire processing pipeline. In this paper, we introduce PRIVSPIKE, a privacy-preserving inference framework for SNNs using the CKKS homomorphic encryption scheme. PRIVSPIKE supports arbitrary depth SNNs and introduces two key algorithms for evaluating the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire activation function: (1) a polynomial approximation algorithm designed for high-performance SNN inference, and (2) a novel scheme-switching algorithm that optimizes precision at a higher computational cost. We evaluate PRIVSPIKE on MNIST, CIFAR-10, Neuromorphic MNIST, and CIFAR-10 DVS using models from LeNet-5 and ResNet-19 architectures, achieving encrypted inference accuracies of 98.10%, 79.3%, 98.1%, and 66.0%, respectively. On a consumer-grade CPU, SNN LeNet-5 models achieved inference times of 28 seconds on MNIST and 212 seconds on Neuromorphic MNIST. For SNN ResNet-19 models, inference took 784 seconds on CIFAR-10 and 1846 seconds on CIFAR-10 DVS. These results establish PRIVSPIKE as a viable and efficient solution for secure SNN inference, bridging the gap between energy-efficient deep neural networks and strong cryptographic privacy guarantees while outperforming prior encrypted SNN solutions.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

Although quantum computing is a rapidly evolving field of research, it can already benefit from adopting reproducible builds. This paper aims to bridge the gap between the quantum computing and reproducible builds communities. We propose a generalization of the definition of reproducible builds in the quantum setting, motivated by two threat models: one targeting the confidentiality of end users' data during circuit preparation and submission to a quantum computer, and another compromising the integrity of quantum computation results. This work presents three examples that show how classical information can be hidden in transpiled quantum circuits, and two cases illustrating how even minimal modifications to these circuits can lead to incorrect quantum computation results. Our work provides initial steps towards a framework for reproducibility in quantum software toolchains.</p></details> | 24 pages, 13 figures |

These systems combine cryptographic primitives, protocol design, and system architectures to provide transparency and efficiency while raising critical challenges around privacy and regulatory compliance. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of privacy-preserving digital payment systems, covering both decentralized ledgers and CBDCs. We present a taxonomy of privacy goals -- including anonymity, confidentiality, unlinkability, and auditability -- and map them to underlying cryptographic primitives, protocols, and system architectures. Our work adopts a design-oriented perspective, linking high-level privacy objectives to concrete implementations. We also trace the evolution of privacy-preserving digital payment systems through three generations, highlighting shifts from basic anonymity guarantees toward more nuanced privacy-accountability trade-offs. Finally, we identify open challenges, motivating further research into architectures and solutions that balance strong privacy with real-world auditability needs.</p></details> |  |

Thus, its security and robustness is of significant importance. There are many algorithms that provide robustness in the case of malicious clients. However, the aggregator itself may behave maliciously, for example, by biasing the model or tampering with the weights to weaken the models privacy. In this work, we introduce a verifiable federated learning protocol that enables clients to verify the correctness of the aggregators computation without compromising the confidentiality of their updates. Our protocol uses a standard secure aggregation technique to protect individual model updates with a linearly homomorphic authenticator scheme that enables efficient, privacy-preserving verification of the aggregated result. Our construction ensures that clients can detect manipulation by the aggregator while maintaining low computational overhead. We demonstrate that our approach scales to large models, enabling verification over large neural networks with millions of parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPATA: Systematic Pattern Analysis for Detailed and Transparent Data Cards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26640v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the susceptibility of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to data perturbations and adversarial examples, it is crucial to perform a thorough robustness evaluation before any Machine Learning (ML) model is deployed. However, examining a model's decision boundaries and identifying potential vulnerabilities typically requires access to the training and testing datasets, which may pose risks to data privacy and confidentiality. To improve transparency in organizations that handle confidential data or manage critical infrastructure, it is essential to allow external verification and validation of AI without the disclosure of private datasets. This paper presents Systematic Pattern Analysis (SPATA), a deterministic method that converts any tabular dataset to a domain-independent representation of its statistical patterns, to provide more detailed and transparent data cards. SPATA computes the projection of each data instance into a discrete space where they can be analyzed and compared, without risking data leakage. These projected datasets can be reliably used for the evaluation of how different features affect ML model robustness and for the generation of interpretable explanations of their behavior, contributing to more trustworthy AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 3 tables, 6 figures, SynDAiTE, ECML PKDD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Characterizing the Sensitivity to Individual Bit Flips in Client-Side Operations of the CKKS Scheme](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20891v4)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Homomorphic Encryption (HE) enables computation on encrypted data without decryption, making it a cornerstone of privacy-preserving computation in untrusted environments. As HE sees growing adoption in sensitive applications such as secure machine learning and confidential data analysis ensuring its robustness against errors becomes critical. Faults (e.g., transmission errors, hardware malfunctions, or synchronization failures) can corrupt encrypted data and compromise the integrity of HE operations. However, the impact of soft errors (such as bit flips) on modern HE schemes remains unexplored. Specifically, the CKKS scheme-one of the most widely used HE schemes for approximate arithmetic-lacks a systematic study of how such errors propagate across its pipeline, particularly under optimizations like the Residue Number System (RNS) and Number Theoretic Transform (NTT). This work bridges that gap by presenting a theoretical and empirical analysis of CKKS's fault tolerance under single bit-flip errors. We focus on client-side operations (encoding, encryption, decryption, and decoding) and demonstrate that while the vanilla CKKS scheme exhibits some resilience, performance optimizations (RNS/NTT) introduce significant fragility, amplifying error sensitivity. By characterizing these failure modes, we lay the groundwork for error-resilient HE designs, ensuring both performance and integrity in privacy-critical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mapping Quantum Threats: An Engineering Inventory of Cryptographic Dependencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24623v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of large-scale quantum computers, powered by algorithms like Shor's and Grover's, poses an existential threat to modern public-key cryptography. This vulnerability stems from the ability of these machines to efficiently solve the hard mathematical problems - such as integer factorization and the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem - that underpin widely used cryptographic primitives. This includes RSA, Diffie-Hellman (DH), Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH), and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), which are foundational to security across the digital ecosystem. Once Shor's algorithm becomes practically realizable, these primitives will fail, undermining both retrospective confidentiality and cryptographic authenticity - enabling adversaries to decrypt previously captured communications and forge digital signatures. This paper presents a systematic inventory of technologies exposed to quantum threats from the engineering perspective, organized by both technology domain and by implementation environment. While prior research has emphasized theoretical breaks or protocol-level adaptations, this work focuses on the practical landscape - mapping quantum-vulnerable systems across diverse digital infrastructures. The contribution is a cross-domain, cross-environment threat map to guide practitioners, vendors, and policymakers in identifying exposed technologies before the arrival of cryptographically relevant quantum computers.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, to be submitted to IEEE Privacy and Security</p></details> |

Currently, it relies on duplicate-and-forward routing and cryptographic methods based on computational security. However, these approaches neither attain multicast capacity of the network, nor ensure long-term security against advances in computing (information-theoretic security: ITS). Existing ITS solutions--quantum key distribution (QKD), physical layer security (PLS), and secure network coding (SNC)--still fail to enable scalable networks, as their underlying assumptions, such as trusted nodes and wiretap thresholds, gradually become invalid as the network grows. Here, we develop an efficient multi-tree multicast path-finding method to address this issue, integrating it with universal strongly ramp SNC. This system, path-controlled universal strongly ramp SNC (PUSNEC), can be overlaid onto QKD/PLS networks, enabling multicast capacity, ITS, and scalability. We derive the maximum leakage information to an eavesdropper under the probabilistic wiretap network assumption and demonstrate secure multicast in multi-hop networks through numerical simulations. Our quantitative analysis of the secrecyreliability tradeoff highlights a practical approach to achieving secure, reliable multicast on a global scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>59-pa...</summary><p>59-page PDF including 13-page main text (6 figures) and 46-page supplementary material (16 figures, 11 tables)</p></details> |

This paper introduces a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP)-based approach for the verifiable execution of business processes while preserving confidentiality. We integrate ZK virtual machines (zkVMs) into business process management engines through a comprehensive system architecture and a prototypical implementation. Our approach supports chained verifiable computations through proof compositions. On the example of product carbon footprinting, we model sequential footprinting activities and demonstrate how organizations can prove and verify the integrity of verifiable processes without exposing sensitive information. We assess different ZKP proving variants within process models for their efficiency in proving and verifying, and discuss the practical integration of ZKPs throughout the Business Process Management (BPM) lifecycle. Our experiment-driven evaluation demonstrates the automation of process verification under given confidentiality constraints.</p></details> |  |

However, as LLMs handle confidential inputs and are fine-tuned on costly, proprietary datasets, their heightened security requirements slow adoption in privacy-sensitive sectors such as healthcare and finance. We investigate methods to address this gap and propose Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) as a solution for securing end-to-end LLM inference. We validate their practicality by evaluating these compute-intensive workloads entirely within CPU and GPU TEEs. On the CPU side, we conduct an in-depth study running full Llama2 inference pipelines (7B, 13B, 70B) inside Intel's TDX and SGX, accelerated by Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX). We derive 12 insights, including that across various data types, batch sizes, and input lengths, CPU TEEs impose under 10% throughput and 20% latency overheads, further reduced by AMX. We run LLM inference on NVIDIA H100 Confidential Compute GPUs, contextualizing our CPU findings and observing throughput penalties of 4-8% that diminish as batch and input sizes grow. By comparing performance, cost, and security trade-offs, we show how CPU TEEs can be more cost-effective or secure than their GPU counterparts. To our knowledge, our work is the first to comprehensively demonstrate the performance and practicality of modern TEEs across both CPUs and GPUs for enabling confidential LLMs (cLLMs).</p></details> |  |
| **[Secure Confidential Business Information When Sharing Machine Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16352v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-sharing offers significant business value by enabling firms with well-established Machine Learning (ML) models to monetize and share their models with others who lack the resources to develop ML models from scratch. However, concerns over data confidentiality remain a significant barrier to model-sharing adoption, as Confidential Property Inference (CPI) attacks can exploit shared ML models to uncover confidential properties of the model provider's private model training data. Existing defenses often assume that CPI attacks are non-adaptive to the specific ML model they are targeting. This assumption overlooks a key characteristic of real-world adversaries: their responsiveness, i.e., adversaries' ability to dynamically adjust their attack models based on the information of the target and its defenses. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel defense method that explicitly accounts for the responsive nature of real-world adversaries via two methodological innovations: a novel Responsive CPI attack and an attack-defense arms race framework. The former emulates the responsive behaviors of adversaries in the real world, and the latter iteratively enhances both the target and attack models, ultimately producing a secure ML model that is robust against responsive CPI attacks. Furthermore, we propose and integrate a novel approximate strategy into our defense, which addresses a critical computational bottleneck of defense methods and improves defense efficiency. Through extensive empirical evaluations across various realistic model-sharing scenarios, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing defenses by more effectively defending against CPI attacks, preserving ML model utility, and reducing computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

We develop a theoretical framework leveraging entropy-preserving operations and secret-shared verification to achieve provable security against quantum adversaries. Through entropy amplification techniques and quantum-resistant commitments, the protocol establishes $2^{128}$ quantum security guarantees under the quantum random oracle model. Key innovations include a confidentiality-preserving verification mechanism using distributed polynomial commitments, tightened min-entropy bounds with guaranteed non-negativity, and composable security proofs in the quantum universal composability framework. Unlike computational approaches, our method provides information-theoretic security without hardness assumptions while maintaining polynomial complexity. Theoretical analysis demonstrates resilience against known quantum attack vectors, including Grover-accelerated brute force and quantum memory attacks. The protocol achieves parameterization for 128-bit quantum security with efficient $\mathcal{O}(n^{2})$ communication complexity. Extensions to secure multiparty computation and quantum network applications are established, providing a foundation for long-term cryptographic security.</p></details> | 31 pages, 4 tables |

Erasing Sensitive Memorization in Code Language Models via Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13755v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Code Language Models (CLMs) have demonstrated superior performance in software engineering tasks such as code generation and summarization, recent empirical studies reveal a critical privacy vulnerability: these models exhibit unintended memorization of sensitive training data, enabling verbatim reproduction of confidential information when specifically prompted. To address this issue, several approaches, including training data de-duplication and differential privacy augmentation, have been proposed. However, these methods require full-model retraining for deployed CLMs, which incurs substantial computational costs. In this paper, we aim to answer the following research question: Can sensitive information memorized by CLMs be erased effectively and efficiently? We conduct a pioneering investigation into erasing sensitive memorization in CLMs through machine unlearning - a post-hoc modification method that removes specific information from trained models without requiring full retraining. Specifically, we first quantify the memorization risks of sensitive data within CLM training datasets and curate a high-risk dataset of 50,000 sensitive memorized samples as unlearning targets. We study two widely used gradient ascent-based unlearning approaches: the vanilla and constraint-based methods, and introduce CodeEraser, an advanced variant that selectively unlearns sensitive memorized segments in code while preserving the structural integrity and functional correctness of the surrounding code. Extensive experiments on three families of CLMs, i.e., CodeParrot, CodeGen-Mono, and Qwen2.5-Coder, validate the effectiveness and efficiency of CodeEraser in erasing targeted sensitive memorization while maintaining model utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 48th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2026)</p></details> |

To ensure the security of confidential image data, image encryption using visual cryptography plays a crucial role. To share multiple images using visual cryptography, the company organizer utilizes the concept of a universal or common share. Likewise, quantum computing is an emerging technology that facilitates secure communication. The ability of quantum computers to solve certain mathematical problems efficiently threatens the security of many current encryption algorithms. Hence, to leverage the strengths of quantum computing and visual cryptography, this research introduces a novel universal share-based quantum multi-secret sharing technique for secure image communication. Quantum computing enables the scheme to exhibit high resilience to different eavesdropping threats. Consequently, the proposed method offers robust security solution for sharing confidential images across a range of applications, including enterprise data access and military communications.</p></details> |  |

These simulators are typically deployed on cloud platforms, where users submit proprietary circuit designs for simulation. In this work, we demonstrate a novel timing side-channel attack targeting cloud- based quantum simulators. A co-located malicious process can observe fine-grained execution timing patterns to extract sensitive information about concurrently running quantum circuits. We systematically analyze simulator behavior using the QASMBench benchmark suite, profiling timing and memory characteristics across various circuit executions. Our experimental results show that timing profiles exhibit circuit-dependent patterns that can be effectively classified using pattern recognition techniques, enabling the adversary to infer circuit identities and compromise user confidentiality. We were able to achieve 88% to 99.9% identification rate of quantum circuits based on different datasets. This work highlights previously unexplored security risks in quantum simulation environments and calls for stronger isolation mechanisms to protect user workloads</p></details> |  |

While Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) offer promising capabilities for confidential computing, current implementations face significant limitations when applied to Web3 contexts, particularly in security reliability, censorship resistance, and vendor independence. This paper presents dstack, a comprehensive framework that transforms raw TEE technology into a true Zero Trust platform. We introduce three key innovations: (1) Portable Confidential Containers that enable seamless workload migration across heterogeneous TEE environments while maintaining security guarantees, (2) Decentralized Code Management that leverages smart contracts for transparent governance of TEE applications, and (3) Verifiable Domain Management that ensures secure and verifiable application identity without centralized authorities. These innovations are implemented through three core components: dstack-OS, dstack-KMS, and dstack-Gateway. Together, they demonstrate how to achieve both the performance advantages of VM-level TEE solutions and the trustless guarantees required by Web3 applications. Our evaluation shows that dstack provides comprehensive security guarantees while maintaining practical usability for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Decentralized Federated Learning via Explainable Adaptive Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10691v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decentralized federated learning faces privacy risks because model updates can leak data through inference attacks and membership inference, a concern that grows over many client exchanges. Differential privacy offers principled protection by injecting calibrated noise so confidential information remains secure on resource-limited IoT devices. Yet without transparency, black-box training cannot track noise already injected by previous clients and rounds, which forces worst-case additions and harms accuracy. We propose PrivateDFL, an explainable framework that joins hyperdimensional computing with differential privacy and keeps an auditable account of cumulative noise so each client adds only the difference between the required noise and what has already been accumulated. We evaluate on MNIST, ISOLET, and UCI-HAR to span image, signal, and tabular modalities, and we benchmark against transformer-based and deep learning-based baselines trained centrally with Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) and Renyi Differential Privacy (RDP). PrivateDFL delivers higher accuracy, lower latency, and lower energy across IID and non-IID partitions while preserving formal (epsilon, delta) guarantees and operating without a central server. For example, under non-IID partitions, PrivateDFL achieves 24.42% higher accuracy than the Vision Transformer on MNIST while using about 10x less training time, 76x lower inference latency, and 11x less energy, and on ISOLET it exceeds Transformer accuracy by more than 80% with roughly 10x less training time, 40x lower inference latency, and 36x less training energy. Future work will extend the explainable accounting to adversarial clients and adaptive topologies with heterogeneous privacy budgets.</p></details> | 21 pages |

GestaltMatcher, a leading framework in this field, has demonstrated clinical utility across multiple studies, but its reliance on centralized datasets limits further development, as patient data are siloed across institutions and subject to strict privacy regulations. We introduce a federated GestaltMatcher service based on a cross-silo horizontal federated learning framework, which allows hospitals to collaboratively train a global ensemble feature extractor without sharing patient images. Patient data are mapped into a shared latent space, and a privacy-preserving kernel matrix computation framework enables syndrome inference and discovery while safeguarding confidentiality. New participants can directly benefit from and contribute to the system by adopting the global feature extractor and kernel configuration from previous training rounds. Experiments show that the federated service retains over 90% of centralized performance and remains robust to both varying silo numbers and heterogeneous data distributions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Gentle Introduction to Blind signatures: From RSA to Lattice-based Cryptography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02189v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blind signatures were first introduced by David Chaum. They allow a user to have a message signed by a signer without revealing the message itself. This property is particularly useful in applications such as electronic voting and digital cash, where user anonymity is important. In a blind signature scheme, the user blinds their message before sending it to the signer, who signs the blinded message. The user then unblinds the signed message to obtain a valid signature that can be verified publicly, ensuring that the signer cannot trace the signed message back to the original unblinded version. A good analogy is placing the message inside an envelope and having the envelope signed. Once the envelope is opened, the signature remains valid for the enclosed message, ensuring that the content remains confidential. Such constructions provide anonymity and privacy to the user but given a practical quantum computer, the security of traditional crypto-systems providing such features will be broken. To address this, the development of quantum-resistant cryptographic protocols is essential for maintaining the security of digital transactions and data. Aligning with the same goal, this work aims to thoroughly review the background of lattice-based blind signatures. We start with the foundations of digital signatures in the classical settings and then move on to lattice-based constructions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Practical and Private Hybrid ML Inference with Fully Homomorphic Encryption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01253v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In contemporary cloud-based services, protecting users' sensitive data and ensuring the confidentiality of the server's model are critical. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) enables inference directly on encrypted inputs, but its practicality is hindered by expensive bootstrapping and inefficient approximations of non-linear activations. We introduce Safhire, a hybrid inference framework that executes linear layers under encryption on the server while offloading non-linearities to the client in plaintext. This design eliminates bootstrapping, supports exact activations, and significantly reduces computation. To safeguard model confidentiality despite client access to intermediate outputs, Safhire applies randomized shuffling, which obfuscates intermediate values and makes it practically impossible to reconstruct the model. To further reduce latency, Safhire incorporates advanced optimizations such as fast ciphertext packing and partial extraction. Evaluations on multiple standard models and datasets show that Safhire achieves 1.5X - 10.5X lower inference latency than Orion, a state-of-the-art baseline, with manageable communication overhead and comparable accuracy, thereby establishing the practicality of hybrid FHE inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Characterizing Trust Boundary Vulnerabilities in TEE Containers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20962v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) have emerged as a cornerstone of confidential computing, garnering significant attention from both academia and industry. To enable the secure development, execution, and deployment, of applications on TEE platforms, TEE containers have been introduced as middleware solutions. These containers aim to shield applications from potentially malicious operating systems and orchestration interfaces while maintaining usability and reliability. In this paper, we analyze the isolation strategies employed by existing TEE containers to protect secure applications. To address the challenges in analyzing these interfaces, we designed an automated analyzer to precisely identify and evaluate their isolation boundaries. We observed that some TEE containers fail to achieve their intended goals due to critical design and implementation flaws, such as information leakage, rollback attacks, denial-of-service, and Iago attacks, which pose significant security risks. Drawing from our findings, we share key lessons to guide the development of more secure container solutions and discuss emerging trends in TEE containerization design.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we advance a structured roadmap that integrates public health data science with computer science and is grounded in reflexivity. We adopt data equity as a guiding concept: ensuring the fair and inclusive representation, collection, and use of data to prevent the introduction or exacerbation of systemic biases that could lead to invalid downstream inference and decisions. To underscore urgency, we present three public health cases where non-representative datasets and skewed knowledge impede decisions across diverse subgroups. These challenges echo themes in two literatures: public health highlights gaps in high-quality data for specific populations, while computer science and statistics contribute criteria and metrics for diagnosing bias in data and models. Building on these foundations, we propose a working definition of public health data equity and a structured self-audit framework. Our framework integrates core computational principles (fairness, accountability, transparency, ethics, privacy, confidentiality) with key public health considerations (selection bias, representativeness, generalizability, causality, information bias) to guide equitable practice across the data life cycle, from study design and data collection to measurement, analysis, interpretation, and translation. Embedding data equity in routine practice offers a practical path for ensuring that data-driven policies, artificial intelligence, and emerging technologies improve health outcomes for all. Finally, we emphasize the critical understanding that, although data equity is an essential first step, it does not inherently guarantee information, learning, or decision equity.</p></details> | <details><summary>111 p...</summary><p>111 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

This thesis addresses the complex interplay between privacy, verifiability, and auditability in modern AI, particularly in foundation models. It argues that technical solutions that integrate these elements are critical for responsible AI innovation. Drawing from international policy contributions and technical research to identify key risks in the AI pipeline, this work introduces novel technical solutions for critical privacy and verifiability challenges. Specifically, the research introduces techniques for enabling verifiable and auditable claims about AI systems using zero-knowledge cryptography; utilizing secure multi-party computation and trusted execution environments for auditable, confidential deployment of large language models and information retrieval; and implementing enhanced delegation mechanisms, credentialing systems, and access controls to secure interactions with autonomous and multi-agent AI systems. Synthesizing these technical advancements, this dissertation presents a cohesive perspective on balancing privacy, verifiability, and auditability in foundation model-based AI systems, offering practical blueprints for system designers and informing policy discussions on AI safety and governance.</p></details> | PhD thesis |
| **[Enhancing Model Privacy in Federated Learning with Random Masking and Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18911v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The primary goal of traditional federated learning is to protect data privacy by enabling distributed edge devices to collaboratively train a shared global model while keeping raw data decentralized at local clients. The rise of large language models (LLMs) has introduced new challenges in distributed systems, as their substantial computational requirements and the need for specialized expertise raise critical concerns about protecting intellectual property (IP). This highlights the need for a federated learning approach that can safeguard both sensitive data and proprietary models. To tackle this challenge, we propose FedQSN, a federated learning approach that leverages random masking to obscure a subnetwork of model parameters and applies quantization to the remaining parameters. Consequently, the server transmits only a privacy-preserving proxy of the global model to clients during each communication round, thus enhancing the model's confidentiality. Experimental results across various models and tasks demonstrate that our approach not only maintains strong model performance in federated learning settings but also achieves enhanced protection of model parameters compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

As a first step toward this vision, we present Obfuscated Secure Partitioned Decoding (OSPD), a system built on two key innovations. First, Secure Partitioned Decoding (SPD) isolates user prompts within per-user processes residing in a confidential virtual machine (CVM) on the cloud, which are inaccessible for the cloud LLM while allowing it to generate tokens efficiently. Second, Prompt Obfuscation (PO) introduces a novel cryptographic technique that enhances SPD resilience against advanced prompt reconstruction attacks. Together, these innovations ensure OSPD protects both prompt and model confidentiality while maintaining service functionality. OSPD enables practical, privacy-preserving cloud-hosted LLM inference for sensitive applications, such as processing personal data, clinical records, and financial documents.</p></details> |  |

While existing approaches employ cryptographic techniques such as homomorphic encryption, differential privacy, or secure multiparty computation to mitigate inference attacks-including model inversion, membership inference, and gradient leakage-they often suffer from high computational, communication, or memory overheads. Moreover, many methods overlook the confidentiality of the global model itself, which may be proprietary and sensitive. These challenges limit the practicality of secure FL, especially in cross-silo deployments involving large datasets and strict compliance requirements. We present FuSeFL, a fully secure and scalable FL scheme designed for cross-silo settings. FuSeFL decentralizes training across client pairs using lightweight secure multiparty computation (MPC), while confining the server's role to secure aggregation. This design eliminates server bottlenecks, avoids data offloading, and preserves full confidentiality of data, model, and updates throughout training. FuSeFL defends against inference threats, achieves up to 95% lower communication latency and 50% lower server memory usage, and improves accuracy over prior secure FL solutions, demonstrating strong security and efficiency at scale.</p></details> | 15 Pages, 12 Figures |
| **[Efficient and Verifiable Privacy-Preserving Convolutional Computation for CNN Inference with Untrusted Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12832v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in resource-constrained scenarios has driven the development of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) system. However, this approach is susceptible to privacy leakage, as the data sent from the client to the untrusted cloud server often contains sensitive information. Existing CNN privacy-preserving schemes, while effective in ensuring data confidentiality through homomorphic encryption and secret sharing, face efficiency bottlenecks, particularly in convolution operations. In this paper, we propose a novel verifiable privacy-preserving scheme tailored for CNN convolutional layers. Our scheme enables efficient encryption and decryption, allowing resource-constrained clients to securely offload computations to the untrusted cloud server. Additionally, we present a verification mechanism capable of detecting the correctness of the results with a success probability of at least $1-\frac{1}{\left|Z\right|}$. Extensive experiments conducted on 10 datasets and various CNN models demonstrate that our scheme achieves speedups ranging $26 \times$ ~ $\ 87\times$ compared to the original plaintext model while maintaining accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference link: [ICIC 2025](http://www.ic-icc.cn/2025/index.php) will provide further details</p></details> |

However, BCIs also introduce new avenues for cyber-attacks or security compromises. In this article, we analyze the problem and make recommendations for device manufacturers to better secure devices and to help regulators understand where more guidance is needed to protect patient safety and data confidentiality. Device manufacturers should implement the prior suggestions in their BCI products. These recommendations help protect BCI users from undue risks, including compromised personal health and genetic information, unintended BCI-mediated movement, and many other cybersecurity breaches. Regulators should mandate non-surgical device update methods, strong authentication and authorization schemes for BCI software modifications, encryption of data moving to and from the brain, and minimize network connectivity where possible. We also design a hypothetical, average-case threat model that identifies possible cybersecurity threats to BCI patients and predicts the likeliness of risk for each category of threat. BCIs are at less risk of physical compromise or attack, but are vulnerable to remote attack; we focus on possible threats via network paths to BCIs and suggest technical controls to limit network connections.</p></details> |  |
| **[Securing Sideways: Thwarting Lateral Movement by Implementing Active Directory Tiering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11812v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of computing equipment and the advances in services over the Internet has allowed corporations, higher education, and many other organizations to pursue the shared computing network environment. A requirement for shared computing environments is a centralized identity system to authenticate and authorize user access. An organization's digital identity plane is a prime target for cyber threat actors. When compromised, identities can be exploited to steal credentials, create unauthorized accounts, and manipulate permissions-enabling attackers to gain control of the network and undermine its confidentiality, availability, and integrity. Cybercrime losses reached a record of 16.6 B in the United States in 2024. For organizations using Microsoft software, Active Directory is the on-premises identity system of choice. In this article, we examine the challenge of security compromises in Active Directory (AD) environments and present effective strategies to prevent credential theft and limit lateral movement by threat actors. Our proposed approaches aim to confine the movement of compromised credentials, preventing significant privilege escalation and theft. We argue that through our illustration of real-world scenarios, tiering can halt lateral movement and advanced cyber-attacks, thus reducing ransom escalation. Our work bridges a gap in existing literature by combining technical guidelines with theoretical arguments in support of tiering, positioning it as a vital component of modern cybersecurity strategy even though it cannot function in isolation. As the hardware advances and the cloud sourced services along with AI is advancing with unprecedented speed, we think it is important for security experts and the business to work together and start designing and developing software and frameworks to classify devices automatically and accurately within the tiered structure.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[Activate Me!: Designing Efficient Activation Functions for Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning with Fully Homomorphic Encryption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11575v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of machine learning in sensitive areas such as healthcare and defense introduces significant privacy and security challenges. These domains demand robust data protection, as models depend on large volumes of sensitive information for both training and inference. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) presents a compelling solution by enabling computations directly on encrypted data, maintaining confidentiality across the entire machine learning workflow. However, FHE inherently supports only linear operations, making it difficult to implement non-linear activation functions, essential components of modern neural networks. This work focuses on designing, implementing, and evaluating activation functions tailored for FHE-based machine learning. We investigate two commonly used functions: the Square function and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), using LeNet-5 and ResNet-20 architectures with the CKKS scheme from the OpenFHE library. For ReLU, we assess two methods: a conventional low-degree polynomial approximation and a novel scheme-switching technique that securely evaluates ReLU under FHE constraints. Our findings show that the Square function performs well in shallow networks like LeNet-5, achieving 99.4% accuracy with 128 seconds per image. In contrast, deeper models like ResNet-20 benefit more from ReLU. The polynomial approximation yields 83.8% accuracy with 1,145 seconds per image, while our scheme-switching method improves accuracy to 89.8%, albeit with a longer inference time of 1,697 seconds. These results underscore a critical trade-off in FHE-based ML: faster activation functions often reduce accuracy, whereas those preserving accuracy demand greater computational resources.</p></details> |  |
| **[Okapi: Efficiently Safeguarding Speculative Data Accesses in Sandboxed Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08156v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces Okapi, a new hardware/software cross-layer architecture designed to mitigate Transient Execution Side Channel attacks, including Spectre variants, in modern computing systems. Okapi provides a hardware basis for secure speculation in sandboxed environments and can replace expensive speculation barriers in software. At its core, it allows for speculative data accesses to a memory page only after the page has been accessed non-speculatively by the current trust domain. The granularity of the trust domains can be controlled in software to achieve different security and performance trade-offs. For environments with less stringent security needs, the features can be deactivated to remove all performance overhead. Without relying on any software modification, the Okapi hardware features provide full protection against TES breakout attacks, e.g., by Spectre-PHT or Spectre-BTB, at a thread-level granularity. This incurs an average performance overhead of only 3.17% for the SPEC CPU2017 benchmark suite. Okapi introduces the OkapiReset instruction for additional software-level security support. This instruction allows for fine-grained sandboxing with any custom size, resulting in 2.34% performance overhead in our WebAssembly runtime experiment. On top, Okapi provides the possibility to eliminate poisoning attacks. For the highest level of security, the OkapiLoad instruction prevents confidential data from being added to the trust domain after a sequential access, thereby enforcing weak speculative non-interference. In addition, we present a hardware extension that limits the exploitable code space for Spectre gadgets to well-defined sections of the program. Therefore, by ensuring the absence of gadgets in these sections, developers can tailor their software towards achieving beneficial trade-offs between the size of a trust domain and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>AsiaC...</summary><p>AsiaCCS'25 author version</p></details> |
| **[Characterization of GPU TEE Overheads in Distributed Data Parallel ML Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11771v3)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Confidential computing (CC) or trusted execution enclaves (TEEs) is now the most common approach to enable secure computing in the cloud. The recent introduction of GPU TEEs by NVIDIA enables machine learning (ML) models to be trained without leaking model weights or data to the cloud provider. However, the potential performance implications of using GPU TEEs for ML training are not well characterized. In this work, we present an in-depth characterization study on performance overhead associated with running distributed data parallel (DDP) ML training with GPU Trusted Execution Environments (TEE). Our study reveals the performance challenges in DDP training within GPU TEEs. DDP uses ring-all-reduce, a well-known approach, to aggregate gradients from multiple devices. Ring all-reduce consists of multiple scatter-reduce and all-gather operations. In GPU TEEs only the GPU package (GPU and HBM memory) is trusted. Hence, any data communicated outside the GPU packages must be encrypted and authenticated for confidentiality and integrity verification. Hence, each phase of the ring-all-reduce requires encryption and message authentication code (MAC) generation from the sender, and decryption and MAC authentication on the receiver. As the number of GPUs participating in DDP increases, the overhead of secure inter-GPU communication during ring-all-reduce grows proportionally. Additionally, larger models lead to more asynchronous all-reduce operations, exacerbating the communication cost. Our results show that with four GPU TEEs, depending on the model that is being trained, the runtime per training iteration increases by an average of 8x and up to a maximum of 41.6x compared to DDP training without TEE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Confidential Serverless Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21518v3)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although serverless computing offers compelling cost and deployment simplicity advantages, a significant challenge remains in securely managing sensitive data as it flows through the network of ephemeral function executions in serverless computing environments within untrusted clouds. While Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs) offer a promising secure execution environment, their integration with serverless architectures currently faces fundamental limitations in key areas: security, performance, and resource efficiency. We present WALLET, a confidential computing system for secure serverless deployments to overcome these limitations. By employing nested confidential execution and a decoupled guest OS within CVMs, WALLET runs each function in a minimal "trustlet", significantly improving security through a reduced Trusted Computing Base (TCB). Furthermore, by leveraging a data-centric I/O architecture built upon a lightweight LibOS, WALLET optimizes network communication to address performance and resource efficiency challenges. Our evaluation shows that compared to CVM-based deployments, WALLET has 4.3x smaller TCB, improves end-to-end latency (15-93%), achieves higher function density (up to 907x), and reduces inter-function communication (up to 27x) and function chaining latency (16.7-30.2x); thus, WALLET offers a practical system for confidential serverless computing.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, the MAs deployed at distributed access points (APs) work collaboratively with the RIS to establish high-quality propagation links for both primary and secondary transmissions, as well as suppressing the risk of eavesdropping on confidential primary information. We consider both continuous and discrete MA position cases and maximize the secrecy rate of primary transmission under the secondary transmission constraints, respectively. For the continuous position case, we propose a two-layer iterative optimization method based on differential evolution with one-in-one representation (DEO), to find a high-quality solution with relatively moderate computational complexity. For the discrete position case, we first extend the DEO based iterative framework by introducing the mapping and determination operations to handle the characteristic of discrete MA positions. To further reduce the computational complexity, we then design an alternating optimization (AO) iterative framework to solve all variables within a single layer. In particular, we develop an efficient strategy to derive the sub-optimal solution for the discrete MA positions, superseding the DEO-based method. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed MA empowered secure transmission scheme along with its optimization algorithms.</p></details> | 14 pages,6 figures |

While these hardware-based solutions offer strong protection in isolated environments, their effectiveness is being undermined by cloud-native threats such as misconfigurations, compromised APIs, and lateral privilege escalations. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of publicly disclosed attacks and breaches involving HSMs and TPMs in cloud environments, identifying recurring architectural and operational flaws. We propose a taxonomy of attack vectors based on real-world case studies and threat intelligence reports, highlighting the gaps between hardware trust anchors and dynamic cloud ecosystems. Furthermore, we evaluate emerging defensive paradigms: confidential computing, post-quantum cryptography, and decentralized key management systems (dKMS), assessing their potential to address these gaps. Our findings emphasize that securing cloud-based cryptographic trust requires a layered, context-aware approach that integrates both hardware and software safeguards. The study serves as a practical framework for cloud architects and security engineers to reassess key protection strategies in light of evolving threats. To our knowledge, this is the first work to synthesize documented, real-world cloud HSM and TPM failures into a coherent taxonomy grounded in modern threat models.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 Flowcharts, 2 Tables</p></details> |

However, when retrieval involves private or sensitive data, RAG systems are susceptible to extraction attacks that can leak confidential information through generated responses. We propose Privacy-Aware Decoding (PAD), a lightweight, inference-time defense that adaptively injects calibrated Gaussian noise into token logits during generation. PAD integrates confidence-based screening to selectively protect high-risk tokens, efficient sensitivity estimation to minimize unnecessary noise, and context-aware noise calibration to balance privacy with generation quality. A \renyi Differential Privacy (RDP) accountant rigorously tracks cumulative privacy loss, enabling explicit per-response $(\varepsilon, δ)$-DP guarantees for sensitive outputs. Unlike prior approaches requiring retraining or corpus-level filtering, PAD is model-agnostic and operates entirely at decoding time with minimal computational overhead. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that PAD substantially reduces private information leakage while preserving response utility, outperforming existing retrieval- and post-processing-based defenses. Our work takes an important step toward mitigating privacy risks in RAG via decoding strategies, paving the way for universal and scalable privacy solutions in sensitive domains. Our code is available: https://github.com/wang2226/PAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy-Enhanced Adaptive Authentication: User Profiling with Privacy Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20555v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User profiling is a critical component of adaptive risk-based authentication, yet it raises significant privacy concerns, particularly when handling sensitive data. Profiling involves collecting and aggregating various user features, potentially creating quasi-identifiers that can reveal identities and compromise privacy. Even anonymized profiling methods remain vulnerable to re-identification attacks through these quasi-identifiers. This paper introduces a novel privacy-enhanced adaptive authentication protocol that leverages Oblivious Pseudorandom Functions (OPRF), anonymous tokens, and Differential Privacy (DP) to provide robust privacy guarantees. Our proposed approach dynamically adjusts authentication requirements based on real-time risk assessments, enhancing security while safeguarding user privacy. By integrating privacy considerations into the core of adaptive risk-based adaptive authentication, this approach addresses a gap often overlooked in traditional models. Advanced cryptographic techniques ensure confidentiality, integrity, and unlinkability of user data, while differential privacy mechanisms minimize the impact of individual data points on overall analysis. Formal security and privacy proofs demonstrate the protocol's resilience against various threats and its ability to provide strong privacy guarantees. Additionally, a comprehensive performance evaluation reveals that the computational and communication overheads are manageable, making the protocol practical for real-world deployment. By adhering to data protection regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, our protocol not only enhances security but also fosters user trust and compliance with legal standards.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provably Secure Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01084v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have been widely applied, the privacy and security risks they face, such as data leakage and data poisoning, have not been systematically addressed yet. Existing defense strategies primarily rely on heuristic filtering or enhancing retriever robustness, which suffer from limited interpretability, lack of formal security guarantees, and vulnerability to adaptive attacks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the first provably secure framework for RAG systems(SAG). Our framework employs a pre-storage full-encryption scheme to ensure dual protection of both retrieved content and vector embeddings, guaranteeing that only authorized entities can access the data. Through formal security proofs, we rigorously verify the scheme's confidentiality and integrity under a computational security model. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework effectively resists a range of state-of-the-art attacks. This work establishes a theoretical foundation and practical paradigm for verifiably secure RAG systems, advancing AI-powered services toward formally guaranteed security.</p></details> |  |
| **[Medical Image De-Identification Benchmark Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23608v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The de-identification (deID) of protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable information (PII) is a fundamental requirement for sharing medical images, particularly through public repositories, to ensure compliance with patient privacy laws. In addition, preservation of non-PHI metadata to inform and enable downstream development of imaging artificial intelligence (AI) is an important consideration in biomedical research. The goal of MIDI-B was to provide a standardized platform for benchmarking of DICOM image deID tools based on a set of rules conformant to the HIPAA Safe Harbor regulation, the DICOM Attribute Confidentiality Profiles, and best practices in preservation of research-critical metadata, as defined by The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). The challenge employed a large, diverse, multi-center, and multi-modality set of real de-identified radiology images with synthetic PHI/PII inserted. The MIDI-B Challenge consisted of three phases: training, validation, and test. Eighty individuals registered for the challenge. In the training phase, we encouraged participants to tune their algorithms using their in-house or public data. The validation and test phases utilized the DICOM images containing synthetic identifiers (of 216 and 322 subjects, respectively). Ten teams successfully completed the test phase of the challenge. To measure success of a rule-based approach to image deID, scores were computed as the percentage of correct actions from the total number of required actions. The scores ranged from 97.91% to 99.93%. Participants employed a variety of open-source and proprietary tools with customized configurations, large language models, and optical character recognition (OCR). In this paper we provide a comprehensive report on the MIDI-B Challenge's design, implementation, results, and lessons learned.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[Agentic Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02836v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) is critical to ensure data privacy in AI. Over the past few years, the community has proposed a wide range of provably secure PPML schemes that rely on various cryptography primitives. However, when it comes to large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters, the efficiency of PPML is everything but acceptable. For instance, the state-of-the-art solution for confidential LLM inference represents at least 10,000-fold slower performance compared to plaintext inference. The performance gap is even larger when the context length increases. In this position paper, we propose a novel framework named Agentic-PPML to make PPML in LLMs practical. Our key insight is to employ a general-purpose LLM for intent understanding and delegate cryptographically secure inference to specialized models trained on vertical domains. By modularly separating language intent parsing - which typically involves little or no sensitive information - from privacy-critical computation, Agentic-PPML completely eliminates the need for the LLMs to process the encrypted prompts, enabling practical deployment of privacy-preserving LLM-centric services.</p></details> |  |

Organizations, businesses, and individuals now store vast amounts of proprietary, confidential, and personal data digitally. As such, ensuring the security of this data from unauthorized access is critical. Common security measures, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and antivirus software, are constantly evolving to safeguard computer systems and networks. However, these tools primarily focus on defending against external threats, leaving systems vulnerable to insider attacks. Security solutions designed to mitigate risks originating from within the organization are relatively limited and often ineffective. This paper demonstrates how a Local Area Network (LAN) can be covertly exposed to the Internet via an insider attack. Specifically, it illustrates how an external machine can gain access to a LAN by exploiting an unused secondary IP address of the attacked LAN, effectively bypassing existing security mechanisms by also exploiting Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Despite the presence of robust external protections, such as firewalls and IDS, this form of insider attack reveals significant vulnerabilities in the way internal threats are addressed.</p></details> |  |

Privacy mechanisms that provide unbiased noisy answers to linear queries (such as marginals) are known as matrix mechanisms. We propose ResidualPlanner and ResidualPlanner+, two highly scalable matrix mechanisms. ResidualPlanner is both optimal and scalable for answering marginal queries with Gaussian noise, while ResidualPlanner+ provides support for more general workloads, such as combinations of marginals and range queries or prefix-sum queries. ResidualPlanner can optimize for many loss functions that can be written as a convex function of marginal variances (prior work was restricted to just one predefined objective function). ResidualPlanner can optimize the accuracy of marginals in large scale settings in seconds, even when the previous state of the art (HDMM) runs out of memory. It even runs on datasets with 100 attributes in a couple of minutes. Furthermore, ResidualPlanner can efficiently compute variance/covariance values for each marginal (prior methods quickly run out of memory, even for relatively small datasets). ResidualPlanner+ provides support for more complex workloads that combine marginal and range/prefix-sum queries (e.g., a marginal on race, a range query on age, and a combined race/age tabulation that answers age range queries for each race). It even supports custom user-defined workloads on different attributes. With this added flexibility, ResidualPlanner+ is not necessarily optimal, however it is still extremely scalable and outperforms the prior state-of-the-art (HDMM) on prefix-sum queries both in terms of accuracy and speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distilled Large Language Model in Confidential Computing Environment for System-on-Chip Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16226v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in circuit design tasks and have typically undergone multiple rounds of training. Both the trained models and their associated training data are considered confidential intellectual property (IP) and must be protected from exposure. Confidential Computing offers a promising solution to protect data and models through Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). However, existing TEE implementations are not designed to support the resource-intensive nature of LLMs efficiently. In this work, we first present a comprehensive evaluation of the LLMs within a TEE-enabled confidential computing environment, specifically utilizing Intel Trust Domain Extensions (TDX). We constructed experiments on three environments: TEE-based, CPU-only, and CPU-GPU hybrid implementations, and evaluated their performance in terms of tokens per second. Our first observation is that distilled models, i.e., DeepSeek, surpass other models in performance due to their smaller parameters, making them suitable for resource-constrained devices. Also, in the quantized models such as 4-bit quantization (Q4) and 8-bit quantization (Q8), we observed a performance gain of up to 3x compared to FP16 models. Our findings indicate that for fewer parameter sets, such as DeepSeek-r1-1.5B, the TDX implementation outperforms the CPU version in executing computations within a secure environment. We further validate the results using a testbench designed for SoC design tasks. These validations demonstrate the potential of efficiently deploying lightweight LLMs on resource-constrained systems for semiconductor CAD applications.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures; |

They enable secure data processing and sharing in peer-to-peer networks, such as vehicular ad hoc networks of autonomous vehicles, without compromising confidentiality. In these networks, nodes must establish mutual trust to collaborate securely. TEEs can achieve this through remote attestation, where a prover presents evidence of its trustworthiness to a verifier, which then decides whether or not to trust the prover. However, a naive peer-to-peer attestation approach, where every TEE directly attests every other TEE, results in quadratic communication overhead. This is inefficient in dynamic environments, where nodes frequently join and leave the network. To address this, we present Careful Whisper, a gossip-based protocol that disseminates trust efficiently, reducing attestation overhead to linear complexity under ideal conditions. It enables interoperability by enabling transitive trust across heterogeneous networks, and supports trust establishment with offline nodes via relayed attestations. Using a custom discrete-event simulator, we show that Careful Whisper propagates trust both faster and more widely than naive approaches across various network topologies. Our results demonstrate that our protocol is resource efficient, sending ~21.5 KiB and requiring 0.158 seconds per round in a 200-node network, and that our protocol is resilient to attestation failures across various network topologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fiduciary AI for the Future of Brain-Technology Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14339v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain foundation models represent a new frontier in AI: instead of processing text or images, these models interpret real-time neural signals from EEG, fMRI, and other neurotechnologies. When integrated with brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), they may enable transformative applications-from thought controlled devices to neuroprosthetics-by interpreting and acting on brain activity in milliseconds. However, these same systems pose unprecedented risks, including the exploitation of subconscious neural signals and the erosion of cognitive liberty. Users cannot easily observe or control how their brain signals are interpreted, creating power asymmetries that are vulnerable to manipulation. This paper proposes embedding fiduciary duties-loyalty, care, and confidentiality-directly into BCI-integrated brain foundation models through technical design. Drawing on legal traditions and recent advancements in AI alignment techniques, we outline implementable architectural and governance mechanisms to ensure these systems act in users' best interests. Placing brain foundation models on a fiduciary footing is essential to realizing their potential without compromising self-determination.</p></details> | 32 pages |

This paper proposes the Quantum-Resilient Privacy Ledger (QRPL) as an innovative token-based digital currency architecture that incorporates National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-standardised post-quantum cryptography (PQC) with hash-based zero-knowledge proofs to ensure user sovereignty, scalability, and transaction confidentiality. Key contributions include adaptations of ephemeral proof chains for unlinkable transactions, a privacy-weighted Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus to promote equitable participation, and a novel zero-knowledge proof-based mechanism for privacy-preserving selective disclosure. QRPL aims to address critical shortcomings in prevailing CBDC designs, including risks of pervasive surveillance, with a 10-20 second block time to balance security and throughput in future monetary systems. While conceptual, empirical prototypes are planned. Future work includes prototype development to validate these models empirically.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, FL is vulnerable to reconstruction attacks that exploit shared parameters to reveal private training data. In this paper, we address this issue in the cybersecurity domain by applying Multi-Input Functional Encryption (MIFE) to a recent FL implementation for training ML-based network intrusion detection systems. We assess both classical and post-quantum solutions in terms of memory cost and computational overhead in the FL process, highlighting their impact on convergence time.</p></details> |  |

Due to challenges related to distance, altitude, and face orientation, high-resolution imagery and sophisticated neural networks enable accurate face recognition in dynamic environments. However, privacy concerns arise from the extensive surveillance capabilities of UAVs. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates HE with advanced neural networks to secure facial data throughout the inference phase. This method ensures that facial data remains secure with minimal impact on detection accuracy. Specifically, the proposed system leverages the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) scheme to perform computations directly on encrypted data, optimizing computational efficiency and security. Furthermore, we develop an effective data encoding method specifically designed to preprocess the raw facial data into CKKS form in a Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data (SIMD) manner. Building on this, we design a secure inference algorithm to compute on ciphertext without needing decryption. This approach not only protects data privacy during the processing of facial data but also enhances the efficiency of UAV-based face detection systems. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively balances privacy protection and detection performance, making it a viable solution for UAV-based secure face detection. Significantly, our approach (while maintaining data confidentially with HE encryption) can still achieve an accuracy of less than 1% compared to the benchmark without using encryption.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, QFNN-FFD demonstrates exceptional resilience by maintaining an impressive 80% accuracy, highlighting its robustness and readiness for real-world applications. This combination of high performance, security, and robustness against noise positions QFNN-FFD as a transformative advancement in financial technology solutions and establishes it as a new benchmark for privacy-focused fraud detection systems.

| **[Securing Transformer-based AI Execution via Unified TEEs and Crypto-protected Accelerators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03278v2)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Transformer models, e.g., large language models (LLMs), have brought tremendous breakthroughs in various artificial intelligence (AI) tasks, leading to their wide applications in many security-critical domains. Due to their unprecedented scale and prohibitively high development cost, these models have become highly valuable intellectual property for AI stakeholders and are increasingly deployed via machine learning as a service (MLaaS). However, MLaaS often runs on untrusted cloud infrastructure, exposing data and models to potential breaches. Mainstream protection mechanisms leverage trusted execution environments (TEEs) where confidentiality and integrity for secretive data are shielded using hardware-based encryption and integrity checking. Unfortunately, running model inference entirely within TEEs is subject to non-trivial slowdown, which is further exacerbated in LLMs due to the substantial computation and memory footprint involved. Recent studies reveal that the hybrid TEE-based scheme offloading partial model inference operations to the untrusted accelerators (e.g., GPU) is a promising solution. However, prior offloading schemes fail to ensure dual protection of data and model in Transformer inference, as they cannot securely offload critical operations, i.e., Attention and SoftMax, forcing these computations to remain confined within TEEs. To address these challenges, we propose TwinShield, a framework enabling secure Transformer inference in heterogeneous TEE and accelerator systems with dual protection for both model and data. TwinShield offloads ~87% of computation to GPUs and delivers 4.0x - 6.1x speedups over previous approaches across various Transformer models.</p></details> | 15 pages |

It presents both opportunities and risks in ensuring confidentiality and protecting financial data. The purpose of this article is to show the application of quantum technologies in accounting cybersecurity, utilising quantum algorithms and QKD to overcome the limitations of classical computing.

Interestingly, for certain fundamental two-party functions, such as the inner product and Hamming distance, the accuracy of distributed solutions significantly lags behind what can be achieved in the centralized model. For computational differential privacy, however, these limitations can be circumvented using oblivious transfer (used to implement secure multi-party computation). Yet, no results show that oblivious transfer is indeed necessary for accurately estimating a non-Boolean functionality. In particular, for the inner-product functionality, it was previously unknown whether oblivious transfer is necessary even for the best possible constant additive error. In this work, we prove that any computationally differentially private protocol that estimates the inner product over $\{-1,1\}^n \times \{-1,1\}^n$ up to an additive error of $O(n^{1/6})$, can be used to construct oblivious transfer. In particular, our result implies that protocols with sub-polynomial accuracy are equivalent to oblivious transfer. In this accuracy regime, our result improves upon Haitner, Mazor, Silbak, and Tsfadia [STOC '22], who showed that a key-agreement protocol is necessary.</p></details> | Crypto 2025 |

This innovation enables GPUs to securely process AI workloads, providing a robust and efficient solution for handling sensitive data. For end users, transitioning to GPU-CC mode is seamless, requiring no modifications to existing AI applications. However, this ease of adoption contrasts sharply with the complexity of the underlying proprietary systems. The lack of transparency presents significant challenges for security researchers seeking a deeper understanding of GPU-CC's architecture and operational mechanisms. The challenges of analyzing the NVIDIA GPU-CC system arise from a scarcity of detailed specifications, the proprietary nature of the ecosystem, and the complexity of product design. In this paper, we aim to demystify the implementation of NVIDIA GPU-CC system by piecing together the fragmented and incomplete information disclosed from various sources. Our investigation begins with a high-level discussion of the threat model and security principles before delving into the low-level details of each system component. We instrument the GPU kernel module -- the only open-source component of the system -- and conduct a series of experiments to identify the security weaknesses and potential exploits. For certain components that are out of reach through experiments, we propose well-reasoned speculations about their inner working mechanisms. We have responsibly reported all security findings presented in this paper to the NVIDIA PSIRT Team.</p></details> |  |

We introduce ZKPROV, a novel cryptographic framework that enables zero-knowledge proofs of LLM provenance. It allows users to verify that a model is trained on a reliable dataset without revealing sensitive information about it or its parameters. Unlike prior approaches that focus on complete verification of the training process (incurring significant computational cost) or depend on trusted execution environments, ZKPROV offers a distinct balance. Our method cryptographically binds a trained model to its authorized training dataset(s) through zero-knowledge proofs while avoiding proof of every training step. By leveraging dataset-signed metadata and compact model parameter commitments, ZKPROV provides sound and privacy-preserving assurances that the result of the LLM is derived from a model trained on the claimed authorized and relevant dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the ZKPROV in generating this proof and verifying it, achieving a practical solution for real-world deployments. We also provide formal security guarantees, proving that our approach preserves dataset confidentiality while ensuring trustworthy dataset provenance.</p></details> | 12 pages, 1 figure |

As cryptographically relevant quantum computers become a realistic threat, ensuring DNS confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity in the post-quantum era is imperative. In this paper, we present a comprehensive system-level study of post-quantum DNS security across three widely deployed mechanisms: DNSSEC, DNS-over-TLS (DoT), and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH). We propose Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC)-DNS, a unified framework for benchmarking DNS security under legacy, post-quantum, and hybrid cryptographic configurations. Our implementation leverages the Open Quantum Safe (OQS) libraries and integrates lattice- and hash-based primitives into BIND9 and TLS 1.3 stacks. We formalize performance and threat models and analyze the impact of post-quantum key encapsulation and digital signatures on end-to-end DNS resolution. Experimental results on a containerized testbed reveal that lattice-based primitives such as Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (MLKEM) and Falcon offer practical latency and resource profiles, while hash-based schemes like SPHINCS+ significantly increase message sizes and processing overhead. We also examine security implications including downgrade risks, fragmentation vulnerabilities, and susceptibility to denial-of-service amplification. Our findings inform practical guidance for deploying quantum-resilient DNS and contribute to the broader effort of securing core Internet protocols for the post-quantum future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript submitted to ACM, 29 pages, 8 Figures, 15 Tables</p></details> |

Among privacy-enhancing technologies, Homomorphic Encryption (HE) stands out by providing post-quantum cryptographic security and end-to-end data protection, safeguarding data even during computation. While Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have gained attention in HE settings, their use has largely been restricted to encrypted inference. Prior research on encrypted training has primarily focused on logistic regression or has relied on multi-party computation to enable model fine-tuning. This stems from the substantial computational overhead and algorithmic complexity involved in DNNs training under HE. In this paper, we present ReBoot, the first framework to enable fully encrypted and non-interactive training of DNNs. Built upon the CKKS scheme, ReBoot introduces a novel HE-compliant neural network architecture based on local error signals, specifically designed to minimize multiplicative depth and reduce noise accumulation. ReBoot employs a tailored packing strategy that leverages real-number arithmetic via SIMD operations, significantly lowering both computational and memory overhead. Furthermore, by integrating approximate bootstrapping, ReBoot learning algorithm supports effective training of arbitrarily deep multi-layer perceptrons, making it well-suited for machine learning as-a-service. ReBoot is evaluated on both image recognition and tabular benchmarks, achieving accuracy comparable to 32-bit floating-point plaintext training while enabling fully encrypted training. It improves test accuracy by up to +3.27% over encrypted logistic regression, and up to +6.83% over existing encrypted DNN frameworks, while reducing training latency by up to 8.83x. ReBoot is made available to the scientific community as a public repository.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Homomorphic Encryption Framework for Privacy-Preserving Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05636v3)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning (ML) is widely used today, especially through deep neural networks (DNNs), however, increasing computational load and resource requirements have led to cloud-based solutions. To address this problem, a new generation of networks called Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) has emerged, which mimic the behavior of the human brain to improve efficiency and reduce energy consumption. These networks often process large amounts of sensitive information, such as confidential data, and thus privacy issues arise. Homomorphic encryption (HE) offers a solution, allowing calculations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it. This research compares traditional DNNs and SNNs using the Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren (BFV) encryption scheme. The LeNet-5 model, a widely-used convolutional architecture, is used for both DNN and SNN models based on the LeNet-5 architecture, and the networks are trained and compared using the FashionMNIST dataset. The results show that SNNs using HE achieve up to 40% higher accuracy than DNNs for low values of the plaintext modulus t, although their execution time is longer due to their time-coding nature with multiple time-steps.</p></details> |  |

However, the distributed and edge-based nature of 5G-MEC presents privacy and security challenges, including data exposure risks. Ensuring efficient manipulation and security of sensitive data at the edge is crucial. To address these challenges, we investigate the usage of threshold secret sharing in 5G-MEC storage, an approach that enhances both security and dependability. A (k,n) threshold secret sharing scheme splits and stores sensitive data among n nodes, requiring at least k nodes for reconstruction. The solution ensures confidentiality by protecting data against fewer than k colluding nodes and enhances availability by tolerating up to n-k failing nodes. This approach mitigates threats such as unauthorized access and node failures, whether accidental or intentional. We further discuss a method for selecting the convenient MEHs to store the shares, considering the MEHs' trustworthiness level as a main criterion. Although we define our proposal in the context of secret-shared data storage, it can be seen as an independent, standalone selection process for 5G-MEC trustworthy node selection in other scenarios too.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, Accepted to the proceedings of 22nd International Conference on Privacy, Security, and Trust (PST2025)</p></details> |

This paper presents \textbf{EVA-S2PMLP}, an Efficient, Verifiable, and Accurate Secure Two-Party Multi-Layer Perceptron framework that introduces spatial-scale optimization for enhanced privacy and performance. To enable reliable computation under real-number domain, EVA-S2PMLP proposes a secure transformation pipeline that maps scalar inputs to vector and matrix spaces while preserving correctness. The framework includes a suite of atomic protocols for linear and non-linear secure computations, with modular support for secure activation, matrix-vector operations, and loss evaluation. Theoretical analysis confirms the reliability, security, and asymptotic complexity of each protocol. Extensive experiments show that EVA-S2PMLP achieves high inference accuracy and significantly reduced communication overhead, with up to $12.3\times$ improvement over baselines. Evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrates that the framework maintains model utility while ensuring strict data confidentiality, making it a practical solution for privacy-preserving neural network training in finance, healthcare, and cross-organizational AI applications.</p></details> |  |

Recently, clustered federated learning (CFL) has emerged to address this challenge by partitioning users into clusters according to their similarity. However, CFL faces difficulties in training when users are unwilling to share their cluster identities due to privacy concerns. To address these issues, we present an innovative Efficient and Robust Secure Aggregation scheme for CFL, dubbed EBS-CFL. The proposed EBS-CFL supports effectively training CFL while maintaining users' cluster identity confidentially. Moreover, it detects potential poisonous attacks without compromising individual client gradients by discarding negatively correlated gradients and aggregating positively correlated ones using a weighted approach. The server also authenticates correct gradient encoding by clients. EBS-CFL has high efficiency with client-side overhead O(ml + m^2) for communication and O(m^2l) for computation, where m is the number of cluster identities, and l is the gradient size. When m = 1, EBS-CFL's computational efficiency of client is at least O(log n) times better than comparison schemes, where n is the number of clients.In addition, we validate the scheme through extensive experiments. Finally, we theoretically prove the scheme's security.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI 25 |

Traditional AI systems rely on mutable, opaque statistical models prone to epistemic drift and historical revisionism. In contrast, we introduce the concept of the Merkle Automaton, a cryptographically anchored, deterministic computational framework that integrates formal automata theory with blockchain-based commitments. Each agent transition, memory fragment, and reasoning step is committed within a Merkle structure rooted on-chain, rendering it non-repudiable and auditably permanent. To ensure selective access and confidentiality, we derive symmetric encryption keys from ECDH exchanges contextualised by hierarchical privilege lattices. This enforces cryptographic access control over append-only DAG-structured knowledge graphs. Reasoning is constrained by formal logic systems and verified through deterministic traversal of policy-encoded structures. Updates are non-destructive and historied, preserving epistemic lineage without catastrophic forgetting. Zero-knowledge proofs facilitate verifiable, privacy-preserving inclusion attestations. Collectively, this architecture reframes memory not as a cache but as a ledger - one whose contents are enforced by protocol, bound by cryptography, and constrained by formal logic. The result is not an intelligent agent that mimics thought, but an epistemic entity whose outputs are provably derived, temporally anchored, and impervious to post hoc revision. This design lays foundational groundwork for legal, economic, and high-assurance computational systems that require provable memory, unforgeable provenance, and structural truth.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages, includes formal automata specifications, cryptographic constructions, and epistemic architecture schema</p></details> |

Shannon entropy is an important method to quantify the amount of leakage in QIF. This paper focuses on the programs modeled in Boolean constraints and optimizes the two stages of the Shannon entropy computation to implement a scalable precise tool PSE. In the first stage, we design a knowledge compilation language called \ADDAND that combines Algebraic Decision Diagrams and conjunctive decomposition. \ADDAND avoids enumerating possible outputs of a program and supports tractable entropy computation. In the second stage, we optimize the model counting queries that are used to compute the probabilities of outputs. We compare PSE with the state-of-the-art probabilistic approximately correct tool EntropyEstimation, which was shown to significantly outperform the previous precise tools. The experimental results demonstrate that PSE solved 56 more benchmarks compared to EntropyEstimation in a total of 459. For 98\% of the benchmarks that both PSE and EntropyEstimation solved, PSE is at least $10\times$ as efficient as EntropyEstimation.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |

To meet this challenge, the data engineering field has expanded significantly in recent years in both research and industry. Traditionally, data engineering, Machine Learning, and AI workloads have been run on large clusters within data center environments, requiring substantial investment in hardware and maintenance. With the rise of the public cloud, it is now possible to run large applications across nodes without owning or maintaining hardware. Serverless functions such as AWS Lambda provide horizontal scaling and precise billing without the hassle of managing traditional cloud infrastructure. However, when processing large datasets, users often rely on external storage options that are significantly slower than direct communication typical of HPC clusters. We introduce Cylon, a high-performance distributed data frame solution that has shown promising results for data processing using Python. We describe how we took inspiration from the FMI library and designed a serverless communicator to tackle communication and performance issues associated with serverless functions.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in this setting. However, traditional statically-provisioned GNN inference architectures fall short in meeting two crucial demands of intrusion detection: (1) maintaining consistently low detection latency, and (2) handling highly irregular and bursty workloads. To holistically address these challenges, we present GraphFaaS, a serverless architecture tailored for GNN-based intrusion detection. GraphFaaS leverages the elasticity and agility of serverless computing to dynamically scale the GNN inference pipeline. We parallelize and adapt GNN workflows to a serverless environment, ensuring that the system can respond in real time to fluctuating workloads. By decoupling compute resources from static provisioning, GraphFaaS delivers stable inference latency, which is critical for dependable intrusion detection and timely incident response in cybersecurity operations. Preliminary evaluation shows GraphFaaS reduces average detection latency by 85% and coefficient of variation (CV) by 64% compared to the baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ML For Systems workshop at Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

Despite these benefits, challenges such as startup latencies, static configurations, sub-optimal resource allocation and scheduling still exist due to coupled resource offering and workload-agnostic generic scheduling behaviour. These issues often lead to inconsistent function performance and unexpected operational costs for users and service providers. This paper introduces Saarthi, a novel, end-to-end serverless framework that intelligently manages the dynamic resource needs of function workloads, representing a significant step toward self-driving serverless platforms. Unlike platforms that rely on static resource configurations, Saarthi is input-aware, allowing it to intelligently anticipate resource requirements based on the characteristics of an incoming request payload. This input-driven approach reinforces function right-sizing and enables smart request orchestration across available function configurations. Saarthi further integrates a proactive fault-tolerant redundancy mechanism and employs a multi-objective Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model to maintain an optimal function quantity. This optimisation aims to maximise system throughput while simultaneously reducing overall operational costs. We validate the effectiveness of Saarthi by implementing it as a framework atop OpenFaaS. Our results demonstrate Saarthi's ability to achieve up to 1.45x better throughput, 1.84x reduced costs, while maintaining up to 98.3% service level targets with an overhead of up to 0.2 seconds as compared to the baseline OpenFaaS.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, 1 table, 2 algorithms</p></details> |

As these workloads run in heterogeneous environments such as the Edge-Cloud-Space 3D Continuum, they often require intensive parallel computation, which GPUs can perform far more efficiently than CPUs. However, current platforms struggle to manage hardware acceleration effectively, as static user-device assignments fail to ensure SLO compliance under varying loads or placements, and one-time dynamic selections often lead to suboptimal or cost-inefficient configurations. To address these issues, we present Gaia, a GPU-as-a-service model and architecture that makes hardware acceleration a platform concern. Gaia combines (i) a lightweight Execution Mode Identifier that inspects function code at deploy time to emit one of four execution modes, and a Dynamic Function Runtime that continuously reevaluates user-defined SLOs to promote or demote between CPU- and GPU backends. Our evaluation shows that it seamlessly selects the best hardware acceleration for the workload, reducing end-to-end latency by up to 95%. These results indicate that Gaia enables SLO-aware, cost-efficient acceleration for serverless AI across heterogeneous environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>In IE...</summary><p>In IEEE ACM 12th International Conference on Big Data Computing, Applications and Technologies (BDCAT 25), 2025, Nantes, France</p></details> |

Alas, existing serverless data analytics works focus primarily on the serverless execution engine and assume the existence of a "good" query execution plan or rely on user guidance to construct such a plan. Meanwhile, even simple analytics queries on serverless have a huge space of possible plans, with vast differences in both performance and cost among plans. This paper introduces Odyssey, an end-to-end serverless-native data analytics pipeline that integrates a query planner, cost model and execution engine. Odyssey automatically generates and evaluates serverless query plans, utilizing state space pruning heuristics and a novel search algorithm to identify Pareto-optimal plans that balance cost and performance with low latency even for complex queries. Our evaluations demonstrate that Odyssey accurately predicts both monetary cost and latency, and consistently outperforms AWS Athena on cost and/or latency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Roadrunner: Accelerating Data Delivery to WebAssembly-Based Serverless Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01888v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing provides infrastructure management and elastic auto-scaling, therefore reducing operational overhead. By design serverless functions are stateless, which means they typically leverage external remote services to store and exchange data. Transferring data over a network typically involves serialization and deserialization. These operations usually require multiple data copies and transitions between user and kernel space, resulting in overhead from context switching and memory allocation, contributing significantly to increased latency and resource consumption. To address these issues, we present Roadrunner, a sidecar shim that enables near-zero copy and serialization-free data transfer between WebAssembly-based serverless functions. Roadrunner reduces the multiple copies between user space and kernel space by mapping the function memory and moving the data along a dedicated virtual data hose, bypassing the costly processes of serialization and deserialization. This approach reduces data movement overhead and context switching, achieving near-native latency performance for WebAssembly-based serverless functions. Our experimental results demonstrate that Roadrunner significantly improves the inter-function communication latency from 44% up to 89%, reducing the serialization overhead in 97% of data transfer, and increasing throughput by 69 times compared to state-of-the-art WebAssembly-based serverless functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>26th ...</summary><p>26th International Middleware Conference (MIDDLEWARE 25)</p></details> |

In current FaaS platforms, both synchronous and asynchronous calls are executed immediately. In this paper, we present ProFaaStinate, which extends serverless platforms to enable delayed execution of asynchronous function calls. This allows platforms to execute calls at convenient times with higher resource availability or lower load. ProFaaStinate is able to optimize performance without requiring deep integration into the rest of the platform, or a complex systems model. In our evaluation, our prototype built on top of Nuclio can reduce request response latency and workflow duration while also preventing the system from being overloaded during load peaks. Using a document preparation use case, we show a 54% reduction in average request response latency. This reduction in resource usage benefits both platforms and users as cost savings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Proc. of 9th International Workshop on Serverless Computing (WoSC 23)</p></details> |
| **[GeoFF: Federated Serverless Workflows with Data Pre-Fetching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13594v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is a popular cloud computing model in which applications are implemented as work flows of multiple independent functions. While cloud providers usually offer composition services for such workflows, they do not support cross-platform workflows forcing developers to hardcode the composition logic. Furthermore, FaaS workflows tend to be slow due to cascading cold starts, inter-function latency, and data download latency on the critical path. In this paper, we propose GeoFF, a serverless choreography middleware that executes FaaS workflows across different public and private FaaS platforms, including ad-hoc workflow recomposition. Furthermore, GeoFF supports function pre-warming and data pre-fetching. This minimizes end-to-end workflow latency by taking cold starts and data download latency off the critical path. In experiments with our proof-of-concept prototype and a realistic application, we were able to reduce end-to-end latency by more than 50%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Serverless GPU Architecture for Enterprise HR Analytics: A Production-Scale BDaaS Implementation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19689v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial and government organizations increasingly depend on data-driven analytics for workforce, finance, and regulated decision processes, where timeliness, cost efficiency, and compliance are critical. Distributed frameworks such as Spark and Flink remain effective for massive-scale batch or streaming analytics but introduce coordination complexity and auditing overheads that misalign with moderate-scale, latency-sensitive inference. Meanwhile, cloud providers now offer serverless GPUs, and models such as TabNet enable interpretable tabular ML, motivating new deployment blueprints for regulated environments. In this paper, we present a production-oriented Big Data as a Service (BDaaS) blueprint that integrates a single-node serverless GPU runtime with TabNet. The design leverages GPU acceleration for throughput, serverless elasticity for cost reduction, and feature-mask interpretability for IL4/FIPS compliance. We conduct benchmarks on the HR, Adult, and BLS datasets, comparing our approach against Spark and CPU baselines. Our results show that GPU pipelines achieve up to 4.5x higher throughput, 98x lower latency, and 90% lower cost per 1K inferences compared to Spark baselines, while compliance mechanisms add only ~5.7 ms latency with p99 < 22 ms. Interpretability remains stable under peak load, ensuring reliable auditability. Taken together, these findings provide a compliance-aware benchmark, a reproducible Helm-packaged blueprint, and a decision framework that demonstrate the practicality of secure, interpretable, and cost-efficient serverless GPU analytics for regulated enterprise and government settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables.

Public serverless repositories have become key to accelerating the development of serverless applications. However, their growing popularity makes them attractive targets for adversaries. Despite this, the security posture of these repositories remains largely unexplored, exposing developers and organizations to potential risks. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive analysis of the security landscape of serverless components hosted in public repositories. We analyse 2,758 serverless components from five widely used public repositories popular among developers and enterprises, and 125,936 Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates across three widely used IaC frameworks. Our analysis reveals systemic vulnerabilities including outdated software packages, misuse of sensitive parameters, exploitable deployment configurations, susceptibility to typo-squatting attacks and opportunities to embed malicious behaviour within compressed serverless components.

| **[Object as a Service: Simplifying Cloud-Native Development through Serverless Object Abstraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04898v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The function-as-a-service (FaaS) paradigm is envisioned as the next generation of cloud computing systems that mitigate the burden for cloud-native application developers by abstracting them from cloud resource management. However, it does not deal with the application data aspects. As such, developers have to intervene and undergo the burden of managing the application data, often via separate cloud storage services. To further streamline cloud-native application development, in this work, we propose a new paradigm, known as Object as a Service (OaaS) that encapsulates application data and functions into the cloud object abstraction. OaaS relieves developers from resource and data management burden while offering built-in optimization features. Inspired by OOP, OaaS incorporates access modifiers and inheritance into the serverless paradigm that: (a) prevents developers from compromising the system via accidentally accessing underlying data; and (b) enables software reuse in cloud-native application development. Furthermore, OaaS natively supports dataflow semantics. It enables developers to define function workflows while transparently handling data navigation, synchronization, and parallelism issues. To establish the OaaS paradigm, we develop a platform named Oparaca that offers state abstraction for structured and unstructured data with consistency and fault-tolerant guarantees. We evaluated Oparaca under real-world settings against state-of-the-art platforms with respect to the imposed overhead, scalability, and ease of use. The results demonstrate that the object abstraction provided by OaaS can streamline flexible and scalable cloud-native application development with an insignificant overhead on the underlying serverless system.</p></details> |  |

Current systems rely on static pipeline configurations that struggle to adapt to dynamic workload conditions, leading to substantial inefficiencies. We present FlexPipe, a novel system that dynamically reconfigures pipeline architectures during runtime to address these fundamental limitations. FlexPipe decomposes models into fine-grained stages and intelligently adjusts pipeline granularity based on real-time request pattern analysis, implementing three key innovations: fine-grained model partitioning with preserved computational graph constraints, inflight pipeline refactoring with consistent cache transitions, and topology-aware resource allocation that navigates GPU fragmentation. Comprehensive evaluation on an 82-GPU cluster demonstrates that FlexPipe achieves up to 8.5x better resource efficiency while maintaining 38.3% lower latency compared to state-of-the-art systems, reducing GPU reservation requirements from 75% to 30% of peak capacity.</p></details> | EuroSys 26 |
| **[Multi-Event Triggers for Serverless Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21199v3)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is an event-driven serverless cloud computing model in which small, stateless functions are invoked in response to events, such as HTTP requests, new database entries, or messages. Current FaaS platform assume that each function invocation corresponds to a single event. However, from an application perspective, it is desirable to invoke functions in response to a collection of events of different types or only with every n\textsuperscript{th} event. To implement this today, a function would need additional state management, e.g., in a database, and custom logic to determine whether its trigger condition is fulfilled and the actual application code should run. In such an implementation, most function invocations would be rendered essentially useless, leading to unnecessarily high resource usage, latency, and cost for applications. In this paper, we introduce multi-event triggers, through which complex conditions for function invocations can be specified. Specifically, we introduce abstractions for invoking functions based on a set of $n$ events and joins of multiple events of different types. This enables application developers to define intricate conditions for function invocations, workflow steps, and complex event processing. Our evaluation with a proof-of-concept prototype shows that this reduces event--invocation latency by 62.5\% in an incident detection use-case and that our system can handle more than 300,000 requests per second on limited hardware, which is sufficient load for implementation in large FaaS platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publishing at IC2E'25</p></details> |
| **[Towards Energy-Efficient Serverless Computing with Hardware Isolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08180v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing provides just-in-time infrastructure provisioning with rapid elasticity and a finely-grained pricing model. As full control of resource allocation is in the hands of the cloud provider and applications only consume resources when they actually perform work, we believe that serverless computing is uniquely positioned to maximize energy efficiency. However, the focus of current serverless platforms is to run hundreds or thousands of serverless functions from different tenants on traditional server hardware, requiring expensive software isolation mechanisms and a high degree of overprovisioning, i.e., idle servers, to anticipate load spikes. With shared caches, high clock frequencies, and many-core architectures, servers today are optimized for large, singular workloads but not to run thousands of isolated functions. We propose rethinking the serverless hardware architecture to align it with the requirements of serverless software. Specifically, we propose using hardware isolation with individual processors per function instead of software isolation resulting in a serverless hardware stack that consumes energy only when an application actually performs work. In preliminary evaluation with real hardware and a typical serverless workload we find that this could reduce energy consumption overheads by 90.63% or an average 70.8MW.</p></details> |  |

While modern deep learning models offer high predictive accuracy, they often demand substantial computational resources, making them resource-intensive and limiting accessibility. We introduce the Cloud-based Astronomy Inference (CAI) framework to address these challenges. This scalable solution integrates pre-trained foundation models with serverless cloud infrastructure through a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS). CAI enables efficient and scalable inference on astronomical images without extensive hardware. Using a foundation model for redshift prediction as a case study, our extensive experiments cover user devices, HPC (High-Performance Computing) servers, and Cloud. Using redshift prediction with the AstroMAE model demonstrated CAI's scalability and efficiency, achieving inference on a 12.6 GB dataset in only 28 seconds compared to 140.8 seconds on HPC GPUs and 1793 seconds on HPC CPUs. CAI also achieved significantly higher throughput, reaching 18.04 billion bits per second (bps), and maintained near-constant inference times as data sizes increased, all at minimal computational cost (under $5 per experiment). We also process large-scale data up to 1 TB to show CAI's effectiveness at scale. CAI thus provides a highly scalable, accessible, and cost-effective inference solution for the astronomy community.

In this serverless model, FaaS provides an event-driven, function-oriented computing service characterised by fine-grained, usage-based pricing that eliminates cost for idle resources. Platforms like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Cloud Run Functions require developers to configure their function(s) with minimum operational resources for its successful execution. This resource allocation influences both the operational expense and the performance quality of these functions. However, a noticeable lack of platform transparency forces developers to rely on expert knowledge or experience-based ad-hoc decisions to request desired function resources. This makes optimal resource configuration a non-trivial task while adhering to performance constraints. Furthermore, while commercial platforms often scale resources like CPU and network bandwidth proportional to memory, open-source frameworks permit independent configuration of function resources, introducing additional complexity for developers aiming to optimise their functions. These complexities have directed researchers to resolve developer challenges and advance towards an efficient server-less execution model. In this article, we identify different aspects of resource configuration techniques in FaaS settings and propose a taxonomy of factors that influence function design, configuration, run-time cost, and performance guarantees. We conduct an analysis of existing literature on resource configuration to present a comprehensive review of current studies on function configuration. We also identify existing research gaps and suggest future research directions to enhance function configuration and strengthen the capabilities of serverless computing environments to drive its broader adoption.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables, journal</p></details> |

Lumos identifies workload, system, and environment-level performance drivers in the Edge-Cloud Continuum. We benchmark state-of-the-art containers and the Wasm runtime in interpreted mode and with ahead-of-time compilation. Our performance characterization shows that AoT-compiled Wasm images are up to 30x smaller and decrease cold-start latency by up to 16% compared to containers, while interpreted Wasm suffers up to 55x higher warm latency and up to 10x I/O-serialization overhead.</p></details> |  |

However, compared to virtual machines and container hosting services, modern serverless offerings typically impose higher per-unit time and resource charges. Additionally, billing practices such as wall-clock time allocation-based billing, invocation fees, and usage rounding up can further increase costs. This work, for the first time, holistically demystifies these costs by conducting an in-depth, top-down characterization and analysis from user-facing billing models, through request serving architectures, and down to operating system scheduling on major public serverless platforms. We quantify, for the first time, how current billing practices inflate billable resources up to 4.35x beyond actual consumption. Also, our analysis reveals previously unreported cost drivers, such as operational patterns of serving architectures that create overheads, details of resource allocation during keep-alive periods, and OS scheduling granularity effects that directly impact both performance and billing. By tracing the sources of costs from billing models down to OS scheduling, we uncover the rationale behind today's expensive serverless billing model and practices and provide insights for designing performant and cost-effective serverless systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the Proceedings of the Twenty-First European Conference on Computer Systems (EuroSys '26)</p></details> |

Efforts to mitigate this impact typically focus on the infrastructure level such as powering data centers with renewable energy, or through the specific design of energy-efficient software. However, both strategies rely on stakeholder intervention, making their adoption in legacy and already-deployed systems unlikely. As a result, past architectural and implementation decisions continue to incur additional energy usage - a phenomenon we refer to as energy debt. Hence, in this paper, we investigate the potential of serverless computing platforms to automatically reduce energy debt by leveraging the unique access to function source code. Specifically, we explore whether large language models (LLMs) can translate serverless functions into more energy-efficient programming languages while preserving functional correctness. To this end, we design and implement ReFaaS and integrate it into the Fission serverless framework. We evaluate multiple LLMs on their ability to perform such code translations and analyze their impact on energy consumption. Our preliminary results indicate that translated functions can reduce invocation energy by up to 70%, achieving net energy savings after approximately 3,000 to 5,000 invocations, depending on the LLM used. Nonetheless, the approach faces several challenges: not all functions are suitable for translation, and for some, the amortization threshold is significantly higher or unreachable. Despite these limitations, we identify four key research challenges whose resolution could unlock long-term, automated mitigation of energy debt in serverless computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IC2E 2025</p></details> |

However, public cloud providers often struggle to provide performance guarantees for serverless LLM serving due to significant cold start latency caused by substantial model sizes and complex runtime dependencies. To address this problem, we present HydraServe, a serverless LLM serving system designed to minimize cold start latency in public clouds. HydraServe proactively distributes models across servers to quickly fetch them, and overlaps cold-start stages within workers to reduce startup latency. Additionally, HydraServe strategically places workers across GPUs to avoid network contention among cold-start instances. To minimize resource consumption during cold starts, HydraServe further introduces pipeline consolidation that can merge groups of workers into individual serving endpoints. Our comprehensive evaluations under diverse settings demonstrate that HydraServe reduces the cold start latency by 1.7$\times$-- 4.7$\times$ and improves service level objective attainment by 1.43$\times$--1.74$\times$ compared to baselines.</p></details> | Accepted by NSDI'26 |

To enable single-source and efficient serverless acceleration in C++, we introduce Cppless, an end-to-end framework for implementing remote functions which handles the creation, deployment, and invocation of serverless functions. Cppless is built on top of LLVM and requires only two compiler extensions to automatically extract C++ function objects and deploy them to the cloud.

Serverless computing has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these challenges by offering dynamic scalability and resource-efficient execution. Building upon our previous work, which introduced the Serverless Peer Integrated for Robust Training (SPIRT) architecture, this paper presents a comparative analysis of several serverless distributed ML architectures. We examine SPIRT alongside established architectures like ScatterReduce, AllReduce, and MLLess, focusing on key metrics such as training time efficiency, cost-effectiveness, communication overhead, and fault tolerance capabilities. Our findings reveal that SPIRT provides significant improvements in reducing training times and communication overhead through strategies such as parallel batch processing and in-database operations facilitated by RedisAI. However, traditional architectures exhibit scalability challenges and varying degrees of vulnerability to faults and adversarial attacks. The cost analysis underscores the long-term economic benefits of SPIRT despite its higher initial setup costs. This study not only highlights the strengths and limitations of current serverless ML architectures but also sets the stage for future research aimed at developing new models that combine the most effective features of existing systems.</p></details> |  |

However, as modern large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in size, existing serverless platforms often face substantial model startup overhead. This poses a significant challenge in efficiently scaling model instances to accommodate dynamic, bursty workloads commonly observed in real-world inference services. In this paper, we introduce λScale, an efficient serverless inference system to achieve fast model scaling. The key idea behind λScale is to leverage high-speed RDMA networks between GPU nodes for fast model multicast, while enabling distributed inference execution during model transmission -- referred to as "execute-while-load". λScale proposes an efficient model scaling scheme, λPipe, which supports adaptive model multicast and dynamically constructs execution pipelines across receiving nodes for collaborative, distributed inference. Additionally, λScale supports efficient model management across GPU and host memory, allowing fast scaling for models across different storage tiers. Evaluation results show that λScale enables fast model scaling and effectively handles load spikes, achieving up to 5x tail-latency improvement and 31.3% cost reduction compared to state-of-the-art solutions on real-world LLM inference traces.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming Serverless Cold Starts Through OS Co-Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14292v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing promises fine-grained elasticity and operational simplicity, fueling widespread interest from both industry and academia. Yet this promise is undercut by the cold setart problem, where invoking a function after a period of inactivity triggers costly initialization before any work can begin. Even with today's high-speed storage, the prevailing view is that achieving sub-millisecond cold starts requires keeping state resident in memory. This paper challenges that assumption. Our analysis of existing snapshot/restore mechanisms show that OS-level limitations, not storage speed, are the real barrier to ultra-fast restores from disk. These limitations force current systems to either restore state piecemeal in a costly manner or capture too much state, leading to longer restore times and unpredictable performance. Futhermore, current memory primitives exposed by the OS make it difficult to reliably fetch data into memory and avoid costly runtime page faults. To overcome these barriers, we present Spice, an execution engine purpose-built for serverless snapshot/restore. Spice integrates directly with the OS to restore kernel state without costly replay and introduces dedicated primitives for restoring memory mappings efficiently and reliably. As a result, Spice delivers near-warm performance on cold restores from disk, reducing latency by up to 14.9x over state-of-the-art process-based systems and 10.6x over VM-based systems. This proves that high performance and memory elasticity no longer need to be a trade-off in serverless computing.</p></details> |  |

Our analysis shows that for these agents, the cost of running on serverless platforms can reach up to 70% of the cost of LLM API calls. This finding motivates the need for a more efficient, high-density serverless platform. We present TrEnv, a co-designed serverless platform that supports both container- and VM-based environments, optimized for the unique demands of LLM agents. TrEnv reduces startup latency and memory usage through repurposable sandboxes and memory templates, which enable fast reuse and restoration of execution environments. To further reduce overhead in VM-based agent workloads, TrEnv leverages browser sharing and a page cache bypassing mechanism. Evaluations show that TrEnv reduces P99 latency by up to 7X and memory usage by 48% in container-based settings, and achieves up to 58% lower P99 latency and 61% memory savings for VM-based agents compared to state-of-the-art systems like E2B.</p></details> | 38 pages |

Existing solutions such as "keep-alive" or "pre-warming" are costly and unreliable under bursty workloads. We propose universal workers, which are computational units capable of executing any function with minimal initialization overhead. Based on an analysis of production workload traces, our key insight is that requests in Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms show a highly skewed distribution, with most requests invoking a small subset of functions. We exploit this observation to approximate universal workers through locality groups and three-tier caching (handler, install, import). With this work, we aim to enable more efficient and scalable FaaS platforms capable of handling diverse workloads with minimal initialization overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the 2025 IEEE 18th International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD)</p></details> |

Despite its benefits, the distinct characteristics of serverless functions, such as ephemeral execution and fine-grained scalability, pose unique security challenges, particularly in open-source platforms like OpenFaaS. Existing approaches typically address isolated phases of the DevSecOps lifecycle, lacking an integrated and comprehensive security strategy. To bridge this gap, we propose FaaSGuard, a unified DevSecOps pipeline explicitly designed for open-source serverless environments. FaaSGuard systematically embeds lightweight, fail-closed security checks into every stage of the development lifecycle-planning, coding, building, deployment, and monitoring-effectively addressing threats such as injection attacks, hard-coded secrets, and resource exhaustion. We validate our approach empirically through a case study involving 20 real-world serverless functions from public GitHub repositories. Results indicate that FaaSGuard effectively detects and prevents critical vulnerabilities, demonstrating high precision (95%) and recall (91%) without significant disruption to established CI/CD practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Source Code Analysis & Manipulation (SCAM 2025)</p></details> |
| **[The High Cost of Keeping Warm: Characterizing Overhead in Serverless Autoscaling Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03104v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing is transforming cloud application development, but the performance-cost trade-offs of control plane designs remain poorly understood due to a lack of open, cross-platform benchmarks and detailed system analyses. In this work, we address these gaps by designing a serverless system that approximates the scaling behaviors of commercial providers, including AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Run. We systematically compare the performance and cost-efficiency of both synchronous and asynchronous autoscaling policies by replaying real-world workloads and varying key autoscaling parameters. We demonstrate that our open-source systems can closely replicate the operational characteristics of commercial platforms, enabling reproducible and transparent experimentation. By evaluating how autoscaling parameters affect latency, memory usage, and CPU overhead, we reveal several key findings. First, we find that serverless systems exhibit significant computational overhead due to instance churn equivalent to 10-40% of the CPU cycles spent on request handling, primarily originating from worker nodes. Second, we observe high memory allocation due to scaling policy: 2-10 times more than actively used. Finally, we demonstrate that reducing these overheads typically results in significant performance degradation in the current systems, underscoring the need for new, cost-efficient autoscaling strategies. Additionally, we employ a hybrid methodology that combines real control plane deployments with large-scale simulation to extend our evaluation closer to a production scale, thereby bridging the gap between small research clusters and real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Silent Failures in Stateless Systems: Rethinking Anomaly Detection for Serverless Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04969v3)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing has redefined cloud application deployment by abstracting infrastructure and enabling on-demand, event-driven execution, thereby enhancing developer agility and scalability. However, maintaining consistent application performance in serverless environments remains a significant challenge. The dynamic and transient nature of serverless functions makes it difficult to distinguish between benign and anomalous behavior, which in turn undermines the effectiveness of traditional anomaly detection methods. These conventional approaches, designed for stateful and long-running services, struggle in serverless settings where executions are short-lived, functions are isolated, and observability is limited. In this first comprehensive vision paper on anomaly detection for serverless systems, we systematically explore the unique challenges posed by this paradigm, including the absence of persistent state, inconsistent monitoring granularity, and the difficulty of correlating behaviors across distributed functions. We further examine a range of threats that manifest as anomalies, from classical Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks to serverless-specific threats such as Denial-of-Wallet (DoW) and cold start amplification. Building on these observations, we articulate a research agenda for next-generation detection frameworks that address the need for context-aware, multi-source data fusion, real-time, lightweight, privacy-preserving, and edge-cloud adaptive capabilities. Through the identification of key research directions and design principles, we aim to lay the foundation for the next generation of anomaly detection in cloud-native, serverless ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, Preprint accepted at 2025 IEEE International Conference on Service-Oriented System Engineering (SOSE)</p></details> |

However, current serverless inference platforms encounter the coarse-grained and static GPU resource allocation problems during scaling, which leads to high costs and Service Level Objective (SLO) violations in fluctuating workloads. Meanwhile, current platforms only support horizontal scaling for GPU inferences, thus the cold start problem further exacerbates the problems. In this paper, we propose HAS-GPU, an efficient Hybrid Auto-scaling Serverless architecture with fine-grained GPU allocation for deep learning inferences. HAS-GPU proposes an agile scheduler capable of allocating GPU Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) partitions and time quotas with arbitrary granularity and enables significant vertical quota scalability at runtime. To resolve performance uncertainty introduced by massive fine-grained resource configuration spaces, we propose the Resource-aware Performance Predictor (RaPP). Furthermore, we present an adaptive hybrid auto-scaling algorithm with both horizontal and vertical scaling to ensure inference SLOs and minimize GPU costs. The experiments demonstrated that compared to the mainstream serverless inference platform, HAS-GPU reduces function costs by an average of 10.8x with better SLO guarantees. Compared to state-of-the-art spatio-temporal GPU sharing serverless framework, HAS-GPU reduces function SLO violation by 4.8x and cost by 1.72x on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted by Euro-Par 2025</p></details> |
| **[Melding the Serverless Control Plane with the Conventional Cluster Manager for Speed and Resource Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24551v3)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless platforms face a trade-off: conventional cluster managers like Kubernetes offer compatibility for co-locating Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) and Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) components of serverless applications at the cost of high cold-start latency, while specialized FaaS-only systems like Dirigent achieve low latency by sacrificing compatibility, which prevents integrated management and optimization. Our analysis reveals FaaS traffic is bimodal: predictable, sustainable traffic consumes >98% of cluster resources, while sporadic excessive bursts stress the control plane's scaling latency, not its throughput. With these insights, we design PulseNet, a serverless architecture that employs a dual-track control plane tailoring to both traffic types. PulseNet's standard track manages sustainable traffic with long-lived, full-featured Regular Instances under a conventional cluster manager, preserving compatibility and robust features for the majority of the workload. To handle excessive traffic, an expedited track bypasses the slow manager to rapidly create short-lived, disposable Emergency Instances, minimizing cold-start latency and resource waste from idle instances. This hybrid approach achieves 35% better performance than Dirigent, a FaaS-only system, at the same cost and outperforms other Kubernetes-compatible systems by 1.5-3.5x at a 3-70% lower cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Databelt: A Continuous Data Path for Serverless Workflows in the 3D Compute Continuum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15351v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Typically, serverless functions rely on remote storage services for managing state, which can result in increased latency and network communication overhead. In a dynamic environment such as the 3D (Edge-Cloud-Space) Compute Continuum, serverless functions face additional challenges due to frequent changes in network topology. As satellites move in and out of the range of ground stations, functions must make multiple hops to access cloud services, leading to high-latency state access and unnecessary data transfers. In this paper, we present Databelt, a state management framework for serverless workflows designed for the dynamic environment of the 3D Compute Continuum. Databelt introduces an SLO-aware state propagation mechanism that enables the function state to move continuously in orbit. Databelt proactively offloads function states to the most suitable node, such that when functions execute, the data is already present on the execution node or nearby, thus minimizing state access latency and reducing the number of network hops. Additionally, Databelt introduces a function state fusion mechanism that abstracts state management for functions sharing the same serverless runtime. When functions are fused, Databelt seamlessly retrieves their state as a group, reducing redundant network and storage operations and improving overall workflow efficiency. Our experimental results show that Databelt reduces workflow execution time by up to 66% and increases throughput by 50% compared to the baselines. Furthermore, our results show that Databelt function state fusion reduces storage operations latency by up to 20%, by reducing repetitive storage requests for functions within the same runtime, ensuring efficient execution of serverless workflows in highly dynamic network environments such as the 3D Continuum.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comprehensive Review of Denial of Wallet Attacks in Serverless Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19284v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Denial of Wallet (DoW) attack poses a unique and growing threat to serverless architectures that rely on Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) models, exploiting the cost structure of pay-as-you-go billing to financially burden application owners. Unlike traditional Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, which aim to exhaust resources and disrupt service availability, DoW attacks focus on escalating costs without impacting service operation. This review traces the evolution of DoW research, from initial awareness and attack classification to advancements in detection and mitigation strategies. Key developments include the categorisation of attack types-such as Blast DDoW, Continual Inconspicuous DDoW, and Background Chained DDoW-and the creation of simulation tools like DoWTS, which enable safe experimentation and data generation. Recent advancements highlight machine learning approaches, including systems like Gringotts and DoWNet, which leverage deep learning and anomaly detection to identify malicious traffic patterns. Although substantial progress has been made, challenges persist, notably the lack of real-world data and the need for adaptive billing models. This is the first comprehensive literature review dedicated strictly to Denial of Wallet attacks, providing an in-depth analysis of their financial impacts, attack techniques, mitigation strategies, and detection mechanisms within serverless computing. The paper also presents the first detailed examination of simulation and data generation tools used for DoW research, addressing a critical gap in existing cybersecurity literature. By synthesising these key areas, this study serves as a foundational resource for future research and industry efforts in securing pay-as-you-go cloud environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Developers sometimes add a cache layer between the serverless runtime and the database to improve I/O latency. However, in a serverless environment, functions in the same workflow may be scheduled to different nodes with different caches, which can cause non-intuitive anomalies. This paper presents CausalMesh, a novel approach to causally consistent caching in environments where a computation may migrate from one machine to another, such as in serverless computing. CausalMesh is the first cache system that supports coordination-free and abort-free read/write operations and read transactions when clients roam among multiple servers. CausalMesh also supports read-write transactional causal consistency in the presence of client roaming, but at the cost of abort-freedom.

While Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs) offer a promising secure execution environment, their integration with serverless architectures currently faces fundamental limitations in key areas: security, performance, and resource efficiency. We present WALLET, a confidential computing system for secure serverless deployments to overcome these limitations. By employing nested confidential execution and a decoupled guest OS within CVMs, WALLET runs each function in a minimal "trustlet", significantly improving security through a reduced Trusted Computing Base (TCB). Furthermore, by leveraging a data-centric I/O architecture built upon a lightweight LibOS, WALLET optimizes network communication to address performance and resource efficiency challenges. Our evaluation shows that compared to CVM-based deployments, WALLET has 4.3x smaller TCB, improves end-to-end latency (15-93%), achieves higher function density (up to 907x), and reduces inter-function communication (up to 27x) and function chaining latency (16.7-30.2x); thus, WALLET offers a practical system for confidential serverless computing.</p></details> |  |

Its on-demand nature makes it especially appealing for latency-sensitive and bursty workloads. However, the cold start problem, i.e., where the platform incurs significant delay when provisioning new containers, remains the Achilles' heel of such platforms. This paper presents a predictive serverless scheduling framework based on Model Predictive Control to proactively mitigate cold starts, thereby improving end-to-end response time. By forecasting future invocations, the controller jointly optimizes container prewarming and request dispatching, improving latency while minimizing resource overhead. We implement our approach on Apache OpenWhisk, deployed on a Kubernetes-based testbed. Experimental results using real-world function traces and synthetic workloads demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 85% lower tail latency and a 34% reduction in resource usage.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, preprint accepted at MASCOTS 2025</p></details> |

With an Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) approach, frameworks like the Serverless Framework use YAML configurations to define and deploy APIs, tasks, workflows, and event-driven applications on cloud providers, promoting zero-friction development. As with any rapidly evolving ecosystem, there is a need for updated insights into how these tools are used in real-world projects. Building on the methodology established by the Wonderless dataset for serverless computing (and applying multiple new filtering steps), OpenLambdaVerse addresses this gap by creating a dataset of current GitHub repositories that use the Serverless Framework in applications that contain one or more AWS Lambda functions. We then analyze and characterize this dataset to get an understanding of the state-of-the-art in serverless architectures based on this stack. Through this analysis we gain important insights on the size and complexity of current applications, which languages and runtimes they employ, how are the functions triggered, the maturity of the projects, and their security practices (or lack of). OpenLambdaVerse thus offers a valuable, up-to-date resource for both practitioners and researchers that seek to better understand evolving serverless workloads.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 13th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering (IC2E 2025, accepted, to appear)</p></details> |

This gives rise to present an abstract architecture of CNApp as dynamically re-configurable acyclic directed multi graph where vertices are microservices, and edges are the protocols. Generic mechanisms for such reconfigurations evidently correspond to higher-level functions (functionals). This implies also internal abstract architecture of microservice as a collection of event-triggered serverless functions (including functions implementing the protocols) that are composed into event-dependent data-flow graphs, and dynamically reconfigured at the runtime. Again, generic mechanisms for such compositions and reconfigurations correspond to functionals and higher order type theory like Coq https://coq.inria.fr/about-coq. Our contribution is strictly theoretical and relies on the abstract architecture of CNApp that is closely related to the calculus of functionals and relations.

As a result, serverless is becoming increasingly popular to support highly elastic and bursty workloads. However, existing platforms are supported by bloated virtualization stacks, which, combined with bursty and irregular invocations, lead to high memory and latency overheads. To reduce the virtualization stack bloat, we propose Hydra, a virtualized multi-language runtime and platform capable of hosting multiple sandboxes running concurrently. To fully leverage Hydra's virtualized runtime, we revisit the existing serverless platform design to make it colocation-aware across owners and functions, and to feature a caching layer of pre-allocated Hydra instances that can be used by different functions written in different languages to reduce cold starts. We also propose a snapshotting mechanism to checkpoint and restore individual sandboxes. By consolidating multiple serverless function invocations through Hydra, we improve the overall function density (ops/GB-sec) by 2.41x on average compared to OpenWhisk runtimes, the state-of-the-art single-language runtimes used in most serverless platforms, and by 1.43x on average compared to Knative runtimes supporting invocation colocation within the same function. When reproducing the Azure Functions trace, our serverless platform operating Hydra instances reduces the overall memory footprint by 21.3-43.9% compared to operating OpenWhisk instances and by 14.5-30% compared to operating Knative instances. Hydra eliminates cold starts thanks to the pool of pre-warmed runtime instances, reducing p99 latency by 45.3-375.5x compared to OpenWhisk and by 1.9-51.4x compared to Knative.</p></details> |  |

To support reproducible evaluation, we release AAPAset, a weakly labeled dataset of 300,000 Azure Functions workload windows spanning diverse patterns. AAPA reduces SLO violations by up to 50% and lowers latency by 40% compared to Kubernetes HPA, albeit at 2-8x higher resource usage under spike-dominated conditions.

However, developing serverless applications often poses a dilemma -- relying on general-purpose serverless platforms can fall short of delivering satisfactory performance for complex workloads, whereas building application-specific serverless systems undermines the simplicity and generality. In this paper, we propose an extensible design principle for serverless computing. We argue that a platform should enable developers to extend system behaviors for domain-specialized optimizations while retaining a shared, easy-to-use serverless environment. We take data analytics as a representative serverless use case and realize this design principle in Proteus. Proteus introduces a novel abstraction of decision workflows, allowing developers to customize control-plane behaviors for improved application performance. Preliminary results show that Proteus's prototype effectively optimizes analytical query execution and supports fine-grained resource sharing across diverse applications.</p></details> |  |

This optimization reduces cold-start time when booting and loading dependencies at runtime inside a function container. Previous research has extensively focused on reducing cold-start latency for specific functions. However, little attention has been given to skewed production workloads. In such cases, cross-function optimization becomes essential. Without cross-function optimization, a cloud provider is left with two equally poor options: (i) Either the cloud provider gives up optimization for each function in the long tail (which is slow); or (ii) the cloud provider applies function-specific optimizations (e.g., cache function images) to every function in the long tail (which violates the vendor's cache constraints). HotSwap demonstrates cross-function optimization using a novel pre-warming strategy. In this strategy, a pre-initialized live dependency image is migrated to the new function instance. At the same time, HotSwap respects the provider's cache constraints, because a single pre-warmed dependency image in the cache can be shared among all serverless functions that require that image. HotSwap has been tested on seven representative functions from FunctionBench. In those tests, HotSwap accelerates dependency loading for those serverless functions with large dependency requirements by a factor ranging from 2.2 to 3.2. Simulation experiments using Azure traces indicate that HotSwap can save 88\% of space, compared with a previous function-specific method, PreBaking, when sharing a dependency image among ten different functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures.

However, existing serverless platforms lack efficient support for GPUs, hindering their ability to deliver high-performance inference. In this paper, we present Torpor, a serverless platform for GPU-efficient, low-latency inference. To enable efficient sharing of a node's GPUs among numerous inference functions, Torpor maintains models in main memory and dynamically swaps them onto GPUs upon request arrivals (i.e., late binding with model swapping). Torpor uses various techniques, including asynchronous API redirection, GPU runtime sharing, pipelined model execution, and efficient GPU memory management, to minimize latency overhead caused by model swapping. Additionally, we design an interference-aware request scheduling algorithm that utilizes high-speed GPU interconnects to meet latency service-level objectives (SLOs) for individual inference functions. We have implemented Torpor and evaluated its performance in a production environment. Utilizing late binding and model swapping, Torpor can concurrently serve hundreds of inference functions on a worker node with 4 GPUs, while achieving latency performance comparable to native execution, where each model is cached exclusively on a GPU. Pilot deployment in a leading commercial serverless cloud shows that Torpor reduces the GPU provisioning cost by 70% and 65% for users and the platform, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hiku: Pull-Based Scheduling for Serverless Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15534v2)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing promises convenient abstractions for developing and deploying functions that execute in response to events. In such Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms, scheduling is an integral task, but current scheduling algorithms often struggle with maintaining balanced loads, minimizing cold starts, and adapting to commonly occurring bursty workloads. In this work, we propose pull-based scheduling as a novel scheduling algorithm for serverless computing. Our key idea is to decouple worker selection from task assignment, with idle workers requesting new tasks proactively. Experimental evaluation on an open-source FaaS platform shows that pull-based scheduling, compared to other existing scheduling algorithms, significantly improves the performance and load balancing of serverless workloads, especially under high concurrency. The proposed algorithm improves response latencies by 14.9% compared to hash-based scheduling, reduces the frequency of cold starts from 43% to 30%, increases throughput by 8.3%, and achieves a more even load distribution by 12.9% measured by the requests assigned per worker.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the 2025 IEEE 25th International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing (CCGrid)</p></details> |

While existing solutions follow exclusive GPU deployment, we take a step back to explore modern platforms and find that: Emerging CPU architectures with built-in accelerators are capable of serving LLMs but remain underutilized, and both CPUs and GPUs can accommodate multiple LLMs simultaneously. We propose LLM-Mesh, a serverless inference scheme for small-to-mid-sized LLMs that enables elastic sharing across heterogeneous hardware. LLM-Mesh tackles three fundamental challenges: (1) precise, fine-grained compute resource allocation at token-level to handle fluctuating computational demands; (2) a coordinated and forward-looking memory scaling mechanism to detect out-of-memory hazards and reduce operational overhead; and (3) a dual approach that reduces resource fragmentation through proactive preemption and reactive bin-packing. Experimental results on 4 32-core CPUs and 4 A100 GPUs show that LLM-Meshimproves service capacity by 44% - 63% through sharing, while further leveraging CPUs boosts this to 91% - 159%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cicada: A Pipeline-Efficient Approach to Serverless Inference with Decoupled Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20959v2)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing has emerged as a pivotal paradigm for deploying Deep Learning (DL) models, offering automatic scaling and cost efficiency. However, the inherent cold start problem in serverless ML inference systems, particularly the time-consuming model loading process, remains a significant bottleneck. Utilizing pipelined model loading improves efficiency but still suffer from pipeline stalls due to sequential layer construction and monolithic weight loading. In this paper, we propose \textit{Cicada}, a novel pipeline optimization framework that coordinates computational, storage, and scheduling resources through three key mechanisms: (1) \textit{MiniLoader}: which reduces layer construction overhead by opportunistically optimizing parameter initialization; (2) \textit{WeightDecoupler}: decoupling weight file processing from layer construction, enabling asynchronous weight retrieval and out-of-order weight application; (3) \textit{Priority-Aware Scheduler}: dynamically allocating resources to ensure high-priority inference tasks are executed promptly. Our experimental results demonstrate that Cicada achieves significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art PISeL framework. Specifically, Cicada reduces end-to-end inference latency by an average of 61.59\%, with the MiniLoader component contributing the majority of this optimization (53.41\%), and the WeightDecoupler achieves up to 26.17\% improvement. Additionally, Cicada achieves up to 2.52x speedup in the inference pipeline utlization compared to PISeL.</p></details> | 13pages, 14 figures |

| **[Joint$λ$: Orchestrating Serverless Workflows on Jointcloud FaaS Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21899v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing serverless workflow orchestration systems are predominantly designed for a single-cloud FaaS system, leading to vendor lock-in. This restricts performance optimization, cost reduction, and availability of applications. However, orchestrating serverless workflows on Jointcloud FaaS systems faces two main challenges: 1) Additional overhead caused by centralized cross-cloud orchestration; and 2) A lack of reliable failover and fault-tolerant mechanisms for cross-cloud serverless workflows. To address these challenges, we propose Joint$λ$, a distributed runtime system designed to orchestrate serverless workflows on multiple FaaS systems without relying on a centralized orchestrator. Joint$λ$ introduces a compatibility layer, Backend-Shim, leveraging inter-cloud heterogeneity to optimize makespan and reduce costs with on-demand billing. By using function-side orchestration instead of centralized nodes, it enables independent function invocations and data transfers, reducing cross-cloud communication overhead. For high availability, it ensures exactly-once execution via datastores and failover mechanisms for serverless workflows on Jointcloud FaaS systems. We validate Joint$λ$ on two heterogeneous FaaS systems, AWS and ALiYun, with four workflows. Compared to the most advanced commercial orchestration services for single-cloud serverless workflows, Joint$λ$ reduces up to 3.3$\times$ latency, saving up to 65\% cost. Joint$λ$ is also faster than the state-of-the-art orchestrators for cross-cloud serverless workflows up to 4.0$\times$, reducing up to 4.5$\times$ cost and providing strong execution guarantees.</p></details> |  |
| **[ServerlessLoRA: Minimizing Latency and Cost in Serverless Inference for LoRA-Based LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14468v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing has grown rapidly for serving Large Language Model (LLM) inference due to its pay-as-you-go pricing, fine-grained GPU usage, and rapid scaling. However, our analysis reveals that current serverless can effectively serve general LLM but fail with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) inference due to three key limitations: 1) massive parameter redundancy among functions where 99% of weights are unnecessarily duplicated, 2) costly artifact loading latency beyond LLM loading, and 3) magnified resource contention when serving multiple LoRA LLMs. These inefficiencies lead to massive GPU wastage, increased Time-To-First-Token (TTFT), and high monetary costs. We propose ServerlessLoRA, a novel serverless inference system designed for faster and cheaper LoRA LLM serving. ServerlessLoRA enables secure backbone LLM sharing across isolated LoRA functions to reduce redundancy. We design a pre-loading method that pre-loads comprehensive LoRA artifacts to minimize cold-start latency. Furthermore, ServerlessLoRA employs contention aware batching and offloading to mitigate GPU resource conflicts during bursty workloads. Experiment on industrial workloads demonstrates that ServerlessLoRA reduces TTFT by up to 86% and cuts monetary costs by up to 89% compared to state-of-the-art LLM inference solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Palladium: A DPU-enabled Multi-Tenant Serverless Cloud over Zero-copy Multi-node RDMA Fabrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11339v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing promises enhanced resource efficiency and lower user costs, yet is burdened by a heavyweight, CPU-bound data plane. Prior efforts exploiting shared memory reduce overhead locally but fall short when scaling across nodes. Furthermore, serverless environments can have unpredictable and large-scale multi-tenancy, leading to contention for shared network resources. We present Palladium, a DPU-centric serverless data plane that reduces the CPU burden and enables efficient, zero-copy communication in multi-tenant serverless clouds. Despite the limited general-purpose processing capability of the DPU cores, Palladium strategically exploits the DPU's potential by (1) offloading data transmission to high-performance NIC cores via RDMA, combined with intra-node shared memory to eliminate data copies across nodes, and (2) enabling cross-processor (CPU-DPU) shared memory to eliminate redundant data movement, which overwhelms wimpy DPU cores. At the core of Palladium is the DPU-enabled network engine (DNE) -- a lightweight reverse proxy that isolates RDMA resources from tenant functions, orchestrates inter-node RDMA flows, and enforces fairness under contention. To further reduce CPU involvement, Palladium performs early HTTP/TCP-to-RDMA transport conversion at the cloud ingress, bridging the protocol mismatch before client traffic enters the RDMA fabric, thus avoiding costly protocol translation along the critical path. We show that careful selection of RDMA primitives (i.e., two-sided instead of one-sided) significantly affects the zero-copy data plane. Our preliminary experimental results show that enabling DPU offloading in Palladium improves RPS by 20.9x. The latency is reduced by a factor of 21x in the best case, all the while saving up to 7 CPU cores, and only consuming two wimpy DPU cores.</p></details> |  |
| **[ABase: the Multi-Tenant NoSQL Serverless Database for Diverse and Dynamic Workloads in Large-scale Cloud Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07692v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-tenant architectures enhance the elasticity and resource utilization of NoSQL databases by allowing multiple tenants to co-locate and share resources. However, in large-scale cloud environments, the diverse and dynamic nature of workloads poses significant challenges for multi-tenant NoSQL databases. Based on our practical observations, we have identified three crucial challenges: (1) the impact of caching on performance isolation, as cache hits alter request execution and resource consumption, leading to inaccurate traffic control; (2) the dynamic changes in traffic, with changes in tenant traffic trends causing throttling or resource wastage, and changes in access distribution causing hot key pressure or cache hit ratio drops; and (3) the imbalanced layout of data nodes due to tenants' diverse resource requirements, leading to low resource utilization. To address these challenges, we introduce ABase, a multi-tenant NoSQL serverless database developed at ByteDance. ABase introduces a two-layer caching mechanism with a cache-aware isolation mechanism to ensure accurate resource consumption estimates. Furthermore, ABase employs a predictive autoscaling policy to dynamically adjust resources in response to tenant traffic changes and a multi-resource rescheduling algorithm to balance resource utilization across data nodes. With these innovations, ABase has successfully served ByteDance's large-scale cloud environment, supporting a total workload that has achieved a peak QPS of over 13 billion and total storage exceeding 1 EB.</p></details> | SIGMOD 2025 accepted |

However, deploying serverless functions across dynamic and heterogeneous environments such as the 3D (Edge-Cloud-Space) Continuum introduces additional complexity. Each layer of the 3D Continuum shows different performance capabilities and costs according to workload characteristics. Cloud services alone often show significant differences in performance and pricing for similar functions, further complicating cost management. Additionally, serverless workflows consist of functions with diverse characteristics, requiring a granular understanding of performance and cost trade-offs across different infrastructure layers to be able to address them individually. In this paper, we present Cosmos, a cost- and a performance-cost-tradeoff model for serverless workflows that identifies key factors that affect cost changes across different workloads and cloud providers. We present a case study analyzing the main drivers that influence the costs of serverless workflows. We demonstrate how to classify the costs of serverless workflows in leading cloud providers AWS and GCP. Our results show that for data-intensive functions, data transfer and state management costs contribute to up to 75% of the costs in AWS and 52% in GCP. For compute-intensive functions such as AI inference, the cost results show that BaaS services are the largest cost driver, reaching up to 83% in AWS and 97% in GCP.</p></details> |  |

In composed workflows, where serverless functions need to exchange data constantly, serverless platforms rely on remote services such as object storage and key-value stores as a common approach to exchange data. In WebAssembly, functions leverage WebAssembly System Interface to connect to the network and exchange data via remote services. As a consequence, co-located serverless functions need remote services to exchange data, increasing latency and adding network overhead. To mitigate this problem, in this paper, we introduce CWASI: a WebAssembly OCI-compliant runtime shim that determines the best inter-function data exchange approach based on the serverless function locality. CWASI introduces a three-mode communication model for the Serverless Edge-Cloud continuum. This communication model enables CWASI Shim to optimize inter-function communication for co-located functions by leveraging the function host mechanisms. Experimental results show that CWASI reduces the communication latency between the co-located serverless functions by up to 95% and increases the communication throughput by up to 30x.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the Eighth ACM/IEEE Symposium on Edge Computing</p></details> |

However, despite these advantages, it faces the significant challenge of cold-start latency, adversely impacting end-to-end performance. Our study shows that many serverless functions initialize libraries that are rarely or never used under typical workloads, thus introducing unnecessary overhead. Although existing static analysis techniques can identify unreachable libraries, they fail to address workload-dependent inefficiencies, resulting in limited performance improvements. To overcome these limitations, we present SLIMSTART, a profile-guided optimization tool designed to identify and mitigate inefficient library usage patterns in serverless applications. By leveraging statistical sampling and call-path profiling, SLIMSTART collects runtime library usage data, generates detailed optimization reports, and applies automated code transformations to reduce cold-start overhead. Furthermore, SLIMSTART integrates seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines, enabling adaptive monitoring and continuous optimizations tailored to evolving workloads. Through extensive evaluation across three benchmark suites and four real-world serverless applications, SLIMSTART achieves up to a 2.30X speedup in initialization latency, a 2.26X improvement in end-to-end latency, and a 1.51X reduction in memory usage, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing cold-start inefficiencies and optimizing resource utilization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 45th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS 2025)</p></details> |

With latency propagation effects becoming increasingly prominent, step-wise resource tuning is required to address Service-Level-Objectives (SLOs). Modern processors' allowance for fine-grained Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), coupled with serverless workflows' intermittent nature, presents a unique opportunity to reduce power while meeting SLOs. We introduce $Ω$kypous, an SLO-driven DVFS framework for serverless workflows. $Ω$kypous employs a grey-box model that predicts functions' execution latency and power under different Core and Uncore frequency combinations. Based on these predictions and the timing slacks between workflow functions, $Ω$kypous uses a closed-loop control mechanism to dynamically adjust Core and Uncore frequencies, thus minimizing power consumption without compromising predefined end-to-end latency constraints. Our evaluation on real-world traces from Azure, against state-of-the-art power management frameworks, demonstrates an average power consumption reduction of 16\%, while consistently maintaining low SLO violation rates (1.8\%), when operating under power caps.</p></details> |  |

However, current orbital edge computing architectures are inflexible, requiring custom mission planning and high upfront development costs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach: shared Earth observation satellites that are operated by a central provider but used by multiple tenants. Each tenant can execute their own logic on-board the satellite to filter, prioritize, and analyze sensor data. We introduce Trabant, a serverless architecture for shared satellite platforms, leveraging the Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) paradigm and time-shifted computing. This architecture abstracts operational complexities, enabling dynamic scheduling under satellite resource constraints, reducing deployment overhead, and aligning event-driven satellite observations with intermittent computation. We present the design of Trabant, demonstrate its capabilities with a proof-of-concept prototype, and evaluate it using real satellite computing telemetry data. Our findings suggest that Trabant can significantly reduce mission planning overheads, offering a scalable and efficient platform for diverse Earth observation missions.</p></details> |  |

However, resource allocation for workflows, particularly those with branching structures, is complicated by cold starts and network delays between dependent functions, significantly degrading execution efficiency and response times. In this paper, we propose the Invocation Concurrency Prediction-Based Scaling (ICPS) algorithm to address these challenges. ICPS employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict function concurrency, dynamically pre-warming function instances, and an affinity-based deployment strategy to co-locate dependent functions on the same worker node, minimizing network latency. The experimental results demonstrate that ICPS consistently outperforms existing approaches in diverse scenarios. The results confirm ICPS as a robust and scalable solution for optimizing serverless workflow execution.</p></details> |  |

While this model offers advantages such as abstraction from the deployment and resource scheduling, it also poses limitations in handling complex use cases due to the restricted nature of individual functions. Serverless workflows address this limitation by orchestrating multiple functions into a cohesive application. However, existing serverless workflow platforms exhibit significant differences in their programming models and infrastructure, making fair and consistent performance evaluations difficult in practice. To address this gap, we propose the first serverless workflow benchmarking suite SeBS-Flow, providing a platform-agnostic workflow model that enables consistent benchmarking across various platforms. SeBS-Flow includes six real-world application benchmarks and four microbenchmarks representing different computational patterns. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on three major cloud platforms, assessing performance, cost, scalability, and runtime deviations. We make our benchmark suite open-source, enabling rigorous and comparable evaluations of serverless workflows over time.</p></details> |  |

Many LLM inference tasks rely on the same base model (e.g., LoRA). To leverage this, PipeBoost introduces fault-tolerant pipeline parallelism across both model loading and inference stages. This approach maximizes aggregate PCIe bandwidth and parallel computation across GPUs, enabling faster generation of the first token. PipeBoost also introduces recovery techniques that enable uninterrupted inference services by utilizing the shared advantages of multiple GPUs. Experimental results show that, compared to state-of-the-art low-latency LLM serving systems, PipeBoost reduces inference latency by 31% to 49.8%. For certain models (e.g., OPT-1.3B), PipeBoost achieves cold-start latencies in the range of a few hundred microseconds.</p></details> |  |

The monopolization of cloud computing resembles a feudalistic system, causing a loss of privacy and data ownership. Cloud Computing and the Internet in general face widely recognized challenges, such as (1) the centralization of trust in auxiliary systems (e.g., centralized cloud providers), (2) the seamless and permissionless interoperability of fragmented ecosystems and (2) the effectiveness, verifiability, and confidentiality of the computation. Acurast is a decentralized serverless cloud that addresses all these shortcomings, following the call for a global-scale cloud founded on the principles of the open-source movement. In Acurast, a purpose-built orchestrator, a reputation engine, and an attestation service are enshrined in the consensus layer. Developers can off-load their computations and verify executions cryptographically. Furthermore, Acurast offers a modular execution layer, taking advantage of secure hardware and trusted execution environments, removing the trust required in third parties, and reducing them to cryptographic hardness assumptions. With this modular architecture, Acurast serves as a decentralized and serverless cloud, allowing confidential and verifiable compute backed by the hardware of security and performance mobile devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>v. 0....</summary><p>v. 0.2., March 17th 2025, White Paper</p></details> |

Unfortunately, the distributed nature of serverless computing makes it difficult to port traditional security tools directly. The existing serverless solutions primarily identify potential threats or performance bottlenecks through post-analysis of modified operating system audit logs, detection of encrypted traffic offloading, or the collection of runtime metrics. However, these methods often prove inadequate for comprehensively detecting communication violations across functions. This limitation restricts the real-time log monitoring and validation capabilities in distributed environments while impeding the maintenance of minimal communication overhead. Therefore, this paper presents FaaSMT, which aims to fill this gap by addressing research questions related to security checks and the optimization of performance and costs in serverless applications. This framework employs parallel processing for the collection of distributed data logs, incorporating Merkle Tree algorithms and heuristic optimisation methods to achieve adaptive inline security task execution. The results of experimental trials demonstrate that FaaSMT is capable of effectively identifying major attack types (e.g., Denial of Wallet (DoW) and Business Logic attacks), thereby providing comprehensive monitoring and validation of function executions while significantly reducing performance overhead.</p></details> |  |

DL workloads, especially with large language models, require substantial GPU resources to ensure QoS. However, it is prone to produce GPU fragments (e.g., 15\%-94\%) in serverless DL systems due to the dynamicity of workloads and coarse-grained static GPU allocation mechanisms, gradually eroding the profits offered by serverless elasticity. Different from classical serverless systems that only scale horizontally, we present introspective elasticity (IE), a fine-grained and adaptive two-dimensional co-scaling mechanism to support GPU resourcing-on-demand for serverless DL tasks. Based on this insight, we build Dilu, a cross-layer and GPU-based serverless DL system with IE support. First, Dilu provides multi-factor profiling for DL tasks with efficient pruning search methods. Second, Dilu adheres to the resourcing-complementary principles in scheduling to improve GPU utilization with QoS guarantees. Third, Dilu adopts an adaptive 2D co-scaling method to enhance the elasticity of GPU provisioning in real time. Evaluations show that it can dynamically adjust the resourcing of various DL functions with low GPU fragmentation (10\%-46\% GPU defragmentation), high throughput (up to 1.8$\times$ inference and 1.1$\times$ training throughput increment) and QoS guarantees (11\%-71\% violation rate reduction), compared to the SOTA baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncoordinated Access to Serverless Computing in MEC Systems for IoT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00375v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Edge computing is a promising solution to enable low-latency IoT applications, by shifting computation from remote data centers to local devices, less powerful but closer to the end user devices. However, this creates the challenge on how to best assign clients to edge nodes offering compute capabilities. So far, two antithetical architectures are proposed: centralized resource orchestration or distributed overlay. In this work we explore a third way, called uncoordinated access, which consists in letting every device exploring multiple opportunities, to opportunistically embrace the heterogeneity of network and load conditions towards diverse edge nodes. In particular, our contribution is intended for emerging serverless IoT applications, which do not have a state on the edge nodes executing tasks. We model the proposed system as a set of M/M/1 queues and show that it achieves a smaller jitter delay than single edge node allocation. Furthermore, we compare uncoordinated access with state-of-the-art centralized and distributed alternatives in testbed experiments under more realistic conditions. Based on the results, our proposed approach, which requires a tiny fraction of the complexity of the alternatives in both the device and network components, is very effective in using the network resources, while incurring only a small penalty in terms of increased compute load and high percentiles of delay.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional resource allocation in serverless platforms couples CPU and memory, which may not be optimal for all functions. Existing decoupling approaches, while offering some flexibility, are not designed to handle the vast configuration space and complexity of serverless workflows. In this paper, we propose AARC, an innovative, automated framework that decouples CPU and memory resources to provide more flexible and efficient provisioning for serverless workloads. AARC is composed of two key components: Graph-Centric Scheduler, which identifies critical paths in workflows, and Priority Configurator, which applies priority scheduling techniques to optimize resource allocation. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that AARC achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with total search time reductions of 85.8% and 89.6%, and cost savings of 49.6% and 61.7%, respectively, while maintaining SLO compliance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 62nd Design Automation Conference (DAC 2025)</p></details> |
| **[It Takes Two to Tango: Serverless Workflow Serving via Bilaterally Engaged Resource Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14320v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless platforms typically adopt an early-binding approach for function sizing, requiring developers to specify an immutable size for each function within a workflow beforehand. Accounting for potential runtime variability, developers must size functions for worst-case scenarios to ensure service-level objectives (SLOs), resulting in significant resource inefficiency. To address this issue, we propose Janus, a novel resource adaptation framework for serverless platforms. Janus employs a late-binding approach, allowing function sizes to be dynamically adapted based on runtime conditions. The main challenge lies in the information barrier between the developer and the provider: developers lack access to runtime information, while providers lack domain knowledge about the workflow. To bridge this gap, Janus allows developers to provide hints containing rules and options for resource adaptation. Providers then follow these hints to dynamically adjust resource allocation at runtime based on real-time function execution information, ensuring compliance with SLOs. We implement Janus and conduct extensive experiments with real-world serverless workflows. Our results demonstrate that Janus enhances resource efficiency by up to 34.7% compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in the 39th IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS)</p></details> |
| **[KiSS: A Novel Container Size-Aware Memory Management Policy for Serverless in Edge-Cloud Continuum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12540v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing has revolutionized cloud architectures by enabling developers to deploy event-driven applications via lightweight, self-contained virtualized containers. However, serverless frameworks face critical cold-start challenges in resource-constrained edge environments, where traditional solutions fall short. The limitations are especially pronounced in edge environments, where heterogeneity and resource constraints exacerbate inefficiencies in resource utilization. This paper introduces KiSS (Keep it Separated Serverless), a static, container size-aware memory management policy tailored for the edge-cloud continuum. The design of KiSS is informed by a detailed workload analysis that identifies critical patterns in container size, invocation frequency, and memory contention. Guided by these insights, KiSS partitions memory pools into categories for small, frequently invoked containers and larger, resource-intensive ones, ensuring efficient resource utilization while minimizing cold starts and inter-function interference. Using a discrete-event simulator, we evaluate KiSS on edge-cluster environments with real-world-inspired workloads. Results show that KiSS reduces cold-start percentages by 60% and function drops by 56.5%, achieving significant performance gains in resource-constrained settings. This work underscores the importance of workload-driven design in advancing serverless efficiency at the edge.</p></details> |  |

It allows software engineers to develop cloud applications as a set of functions (called serverless functions). However, accurately measuring the performance (i.e., end-to-end response latency) of serverless functions is challenging due to the highly dynamic nature of the environment in which they run. To tackle this problem, a potential solution is to apply checks of performance testing techniques to determine how many repetitions of a given serverless function across a range of inputs are needed to cater to the performance fluctuation. However, the available literature lacks performance testing approaches designed explicitly for serverless computing. In this paper, we propose SCOPE, the first serverless computing-oriented performance testing approach. SCOPE takes into account the unique performance characteristics of serverless functions, such as their short execution durations and on-demand triggering. As such, SCOPE is designed as a fine-grained analysis approach. SCOPE incorporates the accuracy check and the consistency check to obtain the accurate and reliable performance of serverless functions. The evaluation shows that SCOPE provides testing results with 97.25% accuracy, 33.83 percentage points higher than the best currently available technique. Moreover, the superiority of SCOPE over the state-of-the-art holds on all functions that we study.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)</p></details> |

However, this generation has been limited to code snippets. Going one step further, our desideratum is to automatically generate architectural components. This would not only speed up development time, but would also enable us to eventually completely skip the development phase, moving directly from design decisions to deployment. To this end, we conduct an exploratory study on the capability of LLMs to generate architectural components for Functions as a Service (FaaS), commonly known as serverless functions. The small size of their architectural components make this architectural style amenable for generation using current LLMs compared to other styles like monoliths and microservices. We perform the study by systematically selecting open source serverless repositories, masking a serverless function and utilizing state of the art LLMs provided with varying levels of context information about the overall system to generate the masked function. We evaluate correctness through existing tests present in the repositories and use metrics from the Software Engineering (SE) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) domains to evaluate code quality and the degree of similarity between human and LLM generated code respectively. Along with our findings, we also present a discussion on the path forward for using GenAI in architectural component generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Software Architecture (ICSA) 2025 Main Track (https://conf.researchr.org/home/icsa-2025)</p></details> |

Serverless computing and cloud functions offer attractive benefits such as elasticity and cost-effectiveness, but are difficult to apply to data-intensive workloads. Jointly addressing these two main challenges, we present SQUASH, the first fully serverless vector search solution with rich support for hybrid queries. It features OSQ, an optimized and highly parallelizable quantization-based approach for vectors and attributes. Its segment-based storage mechanism enables significant compression in resource-constrained settings and offers efficient dimensional extraction operations. SQUASH performs a single distributed pass to guarantee the return of sufficiently many vectors satisfying the filter predicate, achieving high accuracy and avoiding redundant computation for vectors which fail the predicate. A multi-level search workflow is introduced to prune most vectors early to minimize the load on Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) instances. SQUASH is designed to identify and utilize retention of relevant data in re-used runtime containers, which eliminates redundant I/O and reduces costs. Finally, we demonstrate a new tree-based method for rapid FaaS invocation, enabling the bi-directional flow of data via request/response payloads. Experiments comparing SQUASH with state-of-the-art serverless vector search solutions and server-based baselines on vector search benchmarks confirm significant performance improvements at a lower cost.</p></details> |  |

Serverless computing offers a flexible alternative, enabling dynamic resource allocation and automatic scaling. This paper explores how serverless architectures can make large-scale ML inference tasks faster and cost-effective by decomposing monolithic processes into parallel functions. Through a case study on sentiment analysis using the DistilBERT model and the IMDb dataset, we demonstrate that serverless parallel processing can reduce execution time by over 95% compared to monolithic approaches, at the same cost.</p></details> |  |

Although modern data processing systems embrace serverless storage, such as Amazon S3, they continue to manage their compute resources as servers. This is challenging for unpredictable workloads, leaving clusters often underutilized. Recent research shows the potential of serverless compute resources, such as cloud functions, for elastic data processing, but also sees limitations in performance robustness and cost efficiency for long running workloads. These challenges require holistic approaches across the system stack. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no end-to-end data processing system built entirely on serverless infrastructure. In this paper, we present Skyrise, our effort towards building the first fully serverless SQL query processor. Skyrise exploits the elasticity of its underlying infrastructure, while alleviating the inherent limitations with a number of adaptive and cost-aware techniques. We show that both Skyrise's performance and cost are competitive to other cloud data systems for terabyte-scale queries of the analytical TPC-H benchmark.</p></details> |  |

However, existing platforms do not provide an upper bound for the billing model which makes the overall cost unpredictable, precluding many organizations from managing their budgets. Due to the diverse ranges of serverless functions and the heterogeneous capacity of edge devices, it is challenging to receive near-optimal solutions for deployment cost in a polynomial time. In this paper, we investigated the function scheduling problem with a budget constraint for serverless computing in wireless networks. Users and IoT devices are sending requests to edge nodes, improving the latency perceived by users. We propose two online scheduling algorithms based on reinforcement learning, incorporating several important characteristics of serverless functions. Via extensive simulations, we justify the superiority of the proposed algorithm by comparing with an ILP solver (Midaco). Our results indicate that the proposed algorithms efficiently approximate the results of Midaco within a factor of 1.03 while our decision-making time is 5 orders of magnitude less than that of Midaco.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE ICC 2025</p></details> |

Recent work proposed using domain-specific languages to express per-function policies, e.g., policies that enforce the allocation on nodes that enjoy lower latencies to databases and services used by the function. Here, we focus on affinity-aware scenarios, i.e., where, for performance and functional requirements, the allocation of a function depends on the presence/absence of other functions on nodes. We present aAPP, an extension of a declarative, platform-agnostic language that captures affinity-aware scheduling at the FaaS level. We implement an aAPP-based prototype on Apache OpenWhisk. Besides proving that a FaaS platform can capture affinity awareness using aAPP and improve performance in affinity-aware scenarios, we use our prototype to show that aAPP imposes no noticeable overhead in scenarios without affinity constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures, 1 listing. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2407.14159</p></details> |

While monolithic systems run fully on virtual servers, recent systems embrace cloud infrastructure and utilize the disaggregation of compute and storage to scale them independently. The introduction of serverless compute services, such as AWS Lambda, enables finer-grained and elastic scalability within these systems. Prior work shows the viability of serverless infrastructure for scalable data processing yet also sees limitations due to variable performance and cost overhead, in particular for networking and storage. In this paper, we perform a detailed analysis of the performance and cost characteristics of serverless infrastructure in the data processing context. We base our analysis on a large series of micro-benchmarks across different compute and storage services, as well as end-to-end workloads. To enable our analysis, we propose the Skyrise serverless evaluation platform. For the widely used serverless infrastructure of AWS, our analysis reveals distinct boundaries for performance variability in serverless networks and storage. We further present cost break-even points for serverless compute and storage. These insights provide guidance on when and how serverless infrastructure can be efficiently used for data processing.</p></details> |  |

Due to the highly dynamic execution environment, multiple identical runs of the same serverless function can yield different performance, specifically in terms of end-to-end response latency. However, surprisingly, our analysis of serverless computing-related papers published in top-tier conferences highlights that the research community lacks awareness of the performance variance problem, with only 38.38% of these papers employing multiple runs for quantifying it. To further investigate, we analyze the performance of 72 serverless functions collected from these papers. Our findings reveal that the performance of these serverless functions can differ by up to 338.76% (44.28% on average) across different runs. Moreover, 61.11% of these functions produce unreliable performance results, with a low number of repetitions commonly employed in the serverless computing literature. Our study highlights a lack of awareness in the serverless computing community regarding the well-known performance variance problem in software engineering. The empirical results illustrate the substantial magnitude of this variance, emphasizing that ignoring the variance can affect research reproducibility and result reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication in Empirical Software Engineering!</p></details> |

In practice, DTs require proper modeling, coherent development and seamless deployment along cloud and edge landscapes relying on established patterns to reduce operational costs. In this work, we propose KTWIN a Kubernetes-based Serverless Platform for Digital Twins. KTWIN was developed using the state-of-the-art open-source Cloud Native tools, allowing DT operators to easily define models through open standards and configure details of the underlying services and infrastructure. The experiments carried out with the developed prototype show that KTWIN can provide a higher level of abstraction to model and deploy a Digital Twin use case without compromising the solution scalability. The tests performed also show cost savings ranging between 60% and 80% compared to overprovisioned scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have been a dominant type of model architectures to enable large models nowadays, with parallel expert networks. Serving large MoE models on serverless computing is potentially beneficial, but has been underexplored due to substantial challenges in handling the skewed expert popularity and scatter-gather communication bottleneck in MoE model execution, for cost-efficient serverless MoE deployment and performance guarantee. We study optimized MoE model deployment and distributed inference serving on a serverless platform, that effectively predict expert selection, pipeline communication with model execution, and minimize the overall billed cost of serving MoE models. Especially, we propose a Bayesian optimization framework with multi-dimensional epsilon-greedy search to learn expert selections and optimal MoE deployment achieving optimal billed cost, including: 1) a Bayesian decision-making method for predicting expert popularity; 2) flexibly pipelined scatter-gather communication; and 3) an optimal model deployment algorithm for distributed MoE serving. Extensive experiments on AWS Lambda show that our designs reduce the billed cost of all MoE layers by at least 75.67% compared to CPU clusters while maintaining satisfactory inference throughput. As compared to LambdaML in serverless computing, our designs achieves 43.41% lower cost with a throughput decrease of at most 18.76%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shattering the Ephemeral Storage Cost Barrier for Data-Intensive Serverless Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14821v2)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing is a popular cloud deployment paradigm where developers implement applications as workflows of functions that invoke each other. Cloud providers automatically scale function instances on demand and forward workflow requests to appropriate instances. However, current serverless clouds lack efficient cross-function data transfer, limiting the execution of data-intensive applications. Functions often rely on third-party services like AWS S3, AWS ElastiCache, or multi-tier solutions for intermediate data transfers, which introduces inefficiencies. We demonstrate that such through-storage transfers make data-intensive deployments economically impractical, with storage costs comprising more than 24-99% of the total serverless bill. To address this, we introduce Zipline, a fast, API-preserving data communication method for serverless platforms. Zipline enables direct function-to-function transfers, where the sender function buffers payloads in memory and sends a reference to the receiver. The receiver retrieves the data directly from the sender's memory, guided by the load balancer and autoscaler. Zipline integrates seamlessly with existing autoscaling, maintains invocation semantics, and eliminates the costs and overheads of intermediate services. We prototype Zipline in vHive/Knative on AWS EC2 nodes, demonstrating significant improvements. Zipline reduces costs and enhances latency and bandwidth compared to AWS S3 (the lowest-cost solution) and ElastiCache (the highest-performance solution). On real-world applications, Zipline lowers costs by 2-5x and reduces execution times by 1.3-3.4x versus S3. Compared to ElastiCache, Zipline achieves 17-772x cost reductions while improving performance by 2-5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>added...</summary><p>added cost reduction details</p></details> |

It allows cloud data warehouse (or lakehouse) users to focus on data analysis without the burden of managing systems and resources. Accordingly, in serverless query services, users become more concerned about cost-efficiency under acceptable performance than performance under fixed resources. This poses new challenges for serverless query engine design in providing flexible performance service-level agreements (SLAs) and cost-efficiency (i.e., prices). In this paper, we first define the problem of flexible performance SLAs and prices in serverless query processing and discuss its significance. Then, we envision the challenges and solutions for solving this problem and the opportunities it raises for other database research. Finally, we present PixelsDB, an open-source prototype with three service levels supported by dedicated architectural designs. Evaluations show that PixelsDB reduces resource costs by 65.5\% for near-real-world workloads generated by Cloud Analytics Benchmark (CAB) while not violating the pending time guarantees.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

For users who are not system experts, serverless query processing greatly reduces the cost of owning a data analytic system. However, it is still a significant challenge for non-expert users to transform their complex and evolving data analytic needs into proper SQL queries and select a serverless query service that delivers satisfactory performance and price for each type of query. This paper presents PixelsDB, an open-source data analytic system that allows users who lack system or SQL expertise to explore data efficiently. It allows users to generate and debug SQL queries using a natural language interface powered by fine-tuned language models. The queries are then executed by a serverless query engine that offers varying prices for different performance service levels (SLAs). The performance SLAs are natively supported by dedicated architecture design and heterogeneous resource scheduling that can apply cost-efficient resources to process non-urgent queries. We demonstrate that the combination of a serverless paradigm, a natural-language-aided interface, and flexible SLAs and prices will substantially improve the usability of cloud data analytic systems.</p></details> | 4 pages, 4 figures |

To address this issue, we propose Frenzy, a memory-aware serverless computing method for heterogeneous GPU clusters. Frenzy allows users to submit models without worrying about underlying hardware resources. First, Frenzy predicts the required number and type of GPUs by estimating the GPU memory usage of the LLM. Then, it employs a low-overhead heterogeneity-aware scheduling method to optimize training efficiency. We validated Frenzy's performance by conducting multi-task LLM training tests on a heterogeneous GPU cluster with three different GPU types. The results show that Frenzy's memory usage prediction accuracy exceeds 92\%, the scheduling overhead is reduced by 10 times, and it reduces the average job completion time by 12\% to 18\% compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing cloud-based model inference systems are costly, not easy to scale, and must be trusted in handling the models and user request data. Serverless computing presents a new opportunity, as it provides elasticity and fine-grained pricing. Our goal is to design a serverless model inference system that protects models and user request data from untrusted cloud providers. It offers high performance and low cost, while requiring no intrusive changes to the current serverless platforms. To realize our goal, we leverage trusted hardware. We identify and address three challenges in using trusted hardware for serverless model inference. These challenges arise from the high-level abstraction of serverless computing, the performance overhead of trusted hardware, and the characteristics of model inference workloads. We present SeSeMI, a secure, efficient, and cost-effective serverless model inference system. It adds three novel features non-intrusively to the existing serverless infrastructure and nothing else.The first feature is a key service that establishes secure channels between the user and the serverless instances, which also provides access control to models and users' data. The second is an enclave runtime that allows one enclave to process multiple concurrent requests. The final feature is a model packer that allows multiple models to be executed by one serverless instance. We build SeSeMI on top of Apache OpenWhisk, and conduct extensive experiments with three popular machine learning models. The results show that SeSeMI achieves low latency and low cost at scale for realistic workloads.</p></details> |  |

As modern serverless frameworks are typically deployed to extremely large scale distributed computing environments by major cloud providers, Raptor is specifically designed to exploit the property of statistically independent function execution that tends to emerge at very large scales. To demonstrate the effect of horizontal scale on function execution, our evaluation demonstrates that mean delay time improvements provided by Raptor for RSA public-private key pair generation can be accurately predicted by mutually independent exponential random variables, but only once the serverless framework is deployed in a highly available configuration and horizontally scaled across three availability zones.</p></details> |  |

Serverless functions scale up or down based on demand, which means that functions are not directly addressable and rely on platform-managed invocation. Serverless stateless nature requires functions to leverage external services, such as object storage and KVS, to exchange data. Serverless actors have emerged as a solution to these issues. However, the state-of-the-art serverless lifecycle and event-trigger invocation force actors to leverage remote services to manage their state and exchange data, which impacts the performance and incurs additional costs and dependency on third-party services. To address these issues, in this paper, we introduce a novel serverless lifecycle model that allows short-term stateful actors, enabling actors to maintain their state between executions. Additionally, we propose a novel serverless Invocation Model that enables serverless actors to influence the processing of future messages. We present GoldFish, a lightweight WebAssembly short-term stateful serverless actor platform that provides a novel serverless actor lifecycle and invocation model. GoldFish leverages WebAssembly to provide the actors with lightweight sandbox isolation, making them suitable for the Edge-Cloud Continuum, where computational resources are limited. Experimental results show that GoldFish optimizes the data exchange latency by up to 92% and increases the throughput by up to 10x compared to OpenFaaS and Spin.</p></details> | <details><summary>14th ...</summary><p>14th International Conference on the Internet of Things (IoT 2024), November 19--22, 2024, Oulu, Finland</p></details> |

However, the complexity and dynamic nature of serverless applications present significant challenges to ensure system availability and performance. There are many root cause analysis (RCA) methods for microservice systems, but they are not suitable for precise modeling serverless applications. This is because: (1) Compared to microservice, serverless applications exhibit a highly dynamic nature. They have short lifecycle and only generate instantaneous pulse-like data, lacking long-term continuous information. (2) Existing methods solely focus on analyzing the running stage and overlook other stages, failing to encompass the entire lifecycle of serverless applications. To address these limitations, we propose FaaSRCA, a full lifecycle root cause analysis method for serverless applications. It integrates multi-modal observability data generated from platform and application side by using Global Call Graph. We train a Graph Attention Network (GAT) based graph auto-encoder to compute reconstruction scores for the nodes in global call graph. Based on the scores, we determine the root cause at the granularity of the lifecycle stage of serverless functions. We conduct experimental evaluations on two serverless benchmarks, the results show that FaaSRCA outperforms other baseline methods with a top-k precision improvement ranging from 21.25% to 81.63%.</p></details> | issre 2024 |

However, building and running data-intensive serverless workflows also brings new challenges that can significantly degrade the application performance. Cold start remains one of the main challenges that impact the total function execution time. Further, since the serverless functions are not directly addressable, Serverless workflows need to rely on external (storage) services to pass the input data to the downstream functions. Empirical evidence from our experiments shows that the cold start and the function data passing take up the most time in the function execution lifecycle. In this paper, we introduce Truffle - a novel model and architecture that enables efficient inter-function data passing in the Edge-Cloud Continuum by introducing mechanisms that separate computation and I/O, allowing serverless functions to leverage the cold starts to their advantage. Truffle introduces Smart Data Prefetch (SDP) mechanism that abstracts the retrieval of input data for the serverless functions by triggering the data retrieval from the external storage during the function's startup. Truffle's Cold Start Pass (CSP) mechanism optimizes inter-function data passing and data exchange within serverless workflows in the Edge-Cloud Continuum by hooking into the functions' scheduling lifecycle to trigger early data passing during the function's cold start. Experimental results show that by leveraging the data prefetching and cold-start data passing, Truffle reduces the IO latency impact on the total function execution time by up to 77%, improving the function execution time by up to 46% compared to the state-of-the-art data passing approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>The I...</summary><p>The IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Enabling Efficient Serverless Inference Serving for LLM (Large Language Model) in the Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15664v1)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This review report discusses the cold start latency in serverless inference and existing solutions. It particularly reviews the ServerlessLLM method, a system designed to address the cold start problem in serverless inference for large language models. Traditional serverless approaches struggle with high latency due to the size of LLM checkpoints and the overhead of initializing GPU resources. ServerlessLLM introduces a multitier checkpoint loading system, leveraging underutilized GPU memory and storage to reduce startup times by 6--8x compared to existing methods. It also proposes live inference migration and a startup-time-optimized model scheduler, ensuring efficient resource allocation and minimizing delays. This system significantly improves performance and scalability in serverless environments for LLM workloads. Besides ServerlessLLM, several other methods from recent research literature, including Rainbowcake, are reviewed in this paper. Further discussions explore how FaaS providers tackle cold starts and the possible future scopes.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, TUM Cloud Computing Seminar</p></details> |
| **[Fast and Efficient Memory Reclamation For Serverless MicroVMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12893v1)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Resource elasticity is one of the key defining characteristics of the Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) serverless computing paradigm. In order to provide strong multi-tenant isolation, FaaS providers commonly sandbox functions inside virtual machines (VMs or microVMs). While compute resources assigned to VM-sandboxed functions can be seamlessly adjusted on the fly, memory elasticity remains challenging, especially when scaling down. State-of-the-art mechanisms for VM memory elasticity suffer from increased reclaim latency when memory needs to be released, compounded by CPU and memory bandwidth overheads. We identify the obliviousness of the Linux memory manager to the virtually hotplugged memory as the key issue hindering hot-unplug performance, and design HotMem, a novel approach for fast and efficient VM memory hot(un)plug, targeting VM-sandboxed serverless functions. Our key insight is that by segregating virtually hotplugged memory regions from regular VM memory, we are able to bound the lifetimes of allocations within these regions thus enabling their fast and efficient reclamation. We implement HotMem in Linux v6.6 and our evaluation shows that it is an order of magnitude faster than state-of-practice to reclaim VM memory, while achieving the same P99 function latency with a model that statically over-provisions VMs.</p></details> |  |

However, this shift introduces new responsibilities and necessitates a distinct set of skills for practitioners. This study aims to identify and organize the industry requirements for serverless practitioners by conducting a qualitative analysis of 141 job advertisements from seven countries. We developed comprehensive taxonomies of roles, responsibilities, and skills, categorizing 19 responsibilities into four themes: software development, infrastructure and operations, professional development and leadership, and software business. Additionally, we identified 28 hard skills mapped into seven themes and 32 soft skills mapped into eight themes, with the six most demanded soft skills being communication proficiency, continuous learning and adaptability, collaborative teamwork, problem-solving and analytical skills, leadership excellence, and project management. Our findings contribute to understanding the organizational structures and training requirements for effective serverless computing adoption.</p></details> |  |
| **[In Serverless, OS Scheduler Choice Costs Money: A Hybrid Scheduling Approach for Cheaper FaaS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08448v1)** | 2024-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) serverless, large applications are split into short-lived stateless functions. Deploying functions is mutually profitable: users need not be concerned with resource management, while providers can keep their servers at high utilization rates running thousands of functions concurrently on a single machine. It is exactly this high concurrency that comes at a cost. The standard Linux Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) switches often between tasks, which leads to prolonged execution times. We present evidence that relying on the default Linux CFS scheduler increases serverless workloads cost by up to 10X. In this article, we raise awareness and make a case for rethinking the OS-level scheduling in Linux for serverless workloads composed of many short-lived processes. To make serverless more affordable we introduce a hybrid two-level scheduling approach that relies on FaaS characteristics. Short-running functions are executed in FIFO fashion without preemption, while longer-running functions are passed to CFS after a certain time period. We show that tailor-made OS scheduling is able to significantly reduce user-facing costs without adding any provider-facing overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Middleware 2024, author draft made available for timely dissemination</p></details> |

This paper presents a controller-light CI/CD framework in which Jenkins runs as a containerized controller with persistent volumes, delegating heavy build and packaging operations to a remote Docker host. The controller container maintains secure SSH connections to remote compute nodes and focuses solely on orchestration and reporting. Atomic deployments with time-stamped backups, containerized build environments, immutable artifact packaging, and automatic notifications are all integrated into the system. Experimental evaluation shows reduced CPU and RAM usage on the controller, faster build throughput, and lower artifact delivery latency. For small and medium-sized DevOps organizations looking for scalable automation without adding orchestration complexity, this method offers a repeatable, low-maintenance CI/CD pipeline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive-Sensorless Monitoring of Shipping Containers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03022v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monitoring the internal temperature and humidity of shipping containers is essential to preventing quality degradation during cargo transportation. Sensorless monitoring -- machine learning models that predict the internal conditions of the containers using exogenous factors -- shows promise as an alternative to monitoring using sensors. However, it does not incorporate telemetry information and correct for systematic errors, causing the predictions to differ significantly from the live data and confusing the users. In this paper, we introduce the residual correction method, a general framework for correcting for systematic biases in sensorless models after observing live telemetry data. We call this class of models ``adaptive-sensorless'' monitoring. We train and evaluate adaptive-sensorless models on the 3.48 million data points -- the largest dataset of container sensor readings ever used in academic research -- and show that they produce consistent improvements over the baseline sensorless models. When evaluated on the holdout set of the simulated data, they achieve average mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 2.24 $\sim$ 2.31$^\circ$C (vs 2.43$^\circ$C by sensorless) for temperature and 5.72 $\sim$ 7.09% for relative humidity (vs 7.99% by sensorless) and average root mean-squared errors (RMSEs) of 3.19 $\sim$ 3.26$^\circ$C for temperature (vs 3.38$^\circ$C by sensorless) and 7.70 $\sim$ 9.12% for relative humidity (vs 10.0% by sensorless). Adaptive-sensorless models enable more accurate cargo monitoring, early risk detection, and less dependence on full connectivity in global shipping.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2025 IEEE Big Data</p></details> |

Existing approaches such as ray casting and generalized winding numbers often face limitations in robustness and computational efficiency. We propose a fast and numerically stable method for performing containment queries on trimmed surfaces, including those with periodic parameterizations. Our approach introduces a recursive winding number computation scheme that replaces costly curve subdivision with an ellipse-based bound for Bezier segments, enabling linear-time evaluation. For periodic surfaces, we lift trimming curves to the universal covering space, allowing accurate and consistent winding number computation even for non-contractible or discontinuous loops in parameter domain. Experiments show that our method achieves substantial speedups over existing winding-number algorithms while maintaining high robustness in the presence of geometric noise, open boundaries, and periodic topologies. We further demonstrate its effectiveness in processing real B-Rep models and in robust tessellation of trimmed surfaces.</p></details> |  |
| **[HGraphScale: Hierarchical Graph Learning for Autoscaling Microservice Applications in Container-based Cloud Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01881v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Microservice architecture has become a dominant paradigm in application development due to its advantages of being lightweight, flexible, and resilient. Deploying microservice applications in the container-based cloud enables fine-grained elastic resource allocation. Autoscaling is an effective approach to dynamically adjust the resource provisioned to containers. However, the intricate microservice dependencies and the deployment scheme of the container-based cloud bring extra challenges of resource scaling. This article proposes a novel autoscaling approach named HGraphScale. In particular, HGraphScale captures microservice dependencies and the deployment scheme by a newly designed hierarchical graph neural network, and makes effective scaling actions for rapidly changing user requests workloads. Extensive experiments based on real-world traces of user requests are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of HGraphScale. The experiment results show that the HGraphScale outperforms existing state-of-the-art autoscaling approaches by reducing at most 80.16\% of the average response time under a certain VM rental budget of application providers.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Atomic Instruction Gap: Instruction-Tuned LLMs Struggle with Simple, Self-Contained Directives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17388v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction-tuned large language models (IT-LLMs) exhibit strong zero-shot reasoning, yet their ability to execute simple, self-contained instructions remains underexplored, despite this being foundational to complex instruction-following. We evaluate 20 IT-LLMs on modified MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks, by systematically varying the format of option labels (alphabetic, numeric, Roman) while keeping their meaning identical under four paradigms, namely: (1) With explicit instructions, label changes cause large performance shifts (e.g., -30.45\% for Roman vs. numeric), revealing instruction-format bias. (2) Without instructions, performance drops further (up to -10.84\%) and label sensitivity intensifies, underscoring the role of explicit guidance. (3) When option contents are removed, models fail random-choice baselines except with numeric labels, suggesting weak adherence to atomic directives. (4) Three-shot exemplars yield no significant gains in robustness or fidelity, and generation analyses show persistent label errors, especially for non-numeric formats. Across model sizes, larger LLMs achieve higher accuracy but remain inconsistent in instruction adherence. These results expose the insufficiencies of current instruction-tuning paradigms and highlight the need for evaluation methods and training strategies that explicitly target atomic instruction-following.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 1 figure, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[SBOMproof: Beyond Alleged SBOM Compliance for Supply Chain Security of Container Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05798v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supply chain security is extremely important for modern applications running at scale in the cloud. In fact, they involve a large number of heterogeneous microservices that also include third-party software. As a result, security vulnerabilities are hard to identify and mitigate before they start being actively exploited by attackers. For this reason, governments have recently introduced cybersecurity regulations that require vendors to share a software bill of material (SBOM) with end users or regulators. An SBOM can be employed to identify the security vulnerabilities of a software component even without access to its source code, as long as it is accurate and interoperable across different tools. This work evaluates this issue through a comprehensive study of tools for SBOM generation and vulnerability scanning, including both open-source software and cloud services from major providers. We specifically target software containers and focus on operating system packages in Linux distributions that are widely used as base images due to their far-reaching security impact. Our findings show that the considered tools are largely incompatible, leading to inaccurate reporting and a large amount of undetected vulnerabilities. We uncover the SBOM confusion vulnerability, a byproduct of such fragmented ecosystem, where inconsistent formats prevent reliable vulnerability detection across tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Carbon-Aware Container Orchestration: Predicting Workload Energy Consumption with Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03970v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing reliance on large-scale data centers to run resource-intensive workloads has significantly increased the global carbon footprint, underscoring the need for sustainable computing solutions. While container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes help optimize workload scheduling to reduce carbon emissions, existing methods often depend on centralized machine learning models that raise privacy concerns and struggle to generalize across diverse environments. In this paper, we propose a federated learning approach for energy consumption prediction that preserves data privacy by keeping sensitive operational data within individual enterprises. By extending the Kubernetes Efficient Power Level Exporter (Kepler), our framework trains XGBoost models collaboratively across distributed clients using Flower's FedXgbBagging aggregation using a bagging strategy, eliminating the need for centralized data sharing. Experimental results on the SPECPower benchmark dataset show that our FL-based approach achieves 11.7 percent lower Mean Absolute Error compared to a centralized baseline. This work addresses the unresolved trade-off between data privacy and energy prediction efficiency in prior systems such as Kepler and CASPER and offers enterprises a viable pathway toward sustainable cloud computing without compromising operational privacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 IEEE Smart World Congress (SWC 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Container Loading and Unloading through Dual-Cycling and Dockyard Rehandle Reduction Using a Hybrid Genetic Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08534v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the NP-hard problem of optimizing container handling at ports by integrating Quay Crane Dual-Cycling (QCDC) and dockyard rehandle minimization. We realized that there are interdependencies between the unloading sequence of QCDC and the dockyard plan and propose the Quay Crane Dual Cycle - Dockyard Rehandle Genetic Algorithm (QCDC-DR-GA), a hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) that holistically optimizes both aspects: maximizing the number of Dual Cycles (DCs) and minimizing the number of dockyard rehandles. QCDC-DR-GA employs specialized crossover and mutation strategies. Extensive experiments on various ship sizes demonstrate that QCDC-DR-GA reduces total operation time by 15-20% for large ships compared to existing methods. Statistical validation via two-tailed paired t-tests confirms significant improvements at a 5% significance level. The results underscore the inefficiency of isolated optimization and highlight the critical need for integrated algorithms in port operations. This approach increases resource utilization and operational efficiency, offering a cost-effective solution for ports to decrease turnaround times without infrastructure investments.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Benchmark Study of Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for the Container Stowage Planning Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02589v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Container stowage planning (CSPP) is a critical component of maritime transportation and terminal operations, directly affecting supply chain efficiency. Owing to its complexity, CSPP has traditionally relied on human expertise. While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been applied to CSPP, systematic benchmark comparisons across different algorithms remain limited. To address this gap, we develop a Gym environment that captures the fundamental features of CSPP and extend it to include crane scheduling in both multi-agent and single-agent formulations. Within this framework, we evaluate five RL algorithms: DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, and TRPO under multiple scenarios of varying complexity. The results reveal distinct performance gaps with increasing complexity, underscoring the importance of algorithm choice and problem formulation for CSPP. Overall, this paper benchmarks multiple RL methods for CSPP while providing a reusable Gym environment with crane scheduling, thus offering a foundation for future research and practical deployment in maritime logistics.</p></details> |  |
| **[gh0stEdit: Exploiting Layer-Based Access Vulnerability Within Docker Container Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08218v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Containerisation is a popular deployment process for application-level virtualisation using a layer-based approach. Docker is a leading provider of containerisation, and through the Docker Hub, users can supply Docker images for sharing and re-purposing popular software application containers. Using a combination of in-built inspection commands, publicly displayed image layer content, and static image scanning, Docker images are designed to ensure end users can clearly assess the content of the image before running them. In this paper we present gh0stEdit, an exploit that fundamentally undermines the integrity of Docker images and subverts the assumed trust and transparency they utilise. The use of gh0stEdit allows an attacker to maliciously edit Docker images, in a way that is not shown within the image history, hierarchy or commands. This attack can also be carried out against signed images (Docker Content Trust) without invalidating the image signature. We present a detailed case study for this exploit, and showcase how gh0stEdit is able to poison an image in a way that is not picked up through static or dynamic scanning tools. We highlight the issues in the current approach to Docker image security and trust, and expose an attack method which could potentially be exploited in the wild without being detected. To the best of our knowledge we are the first to provide detailed discussion on the exploit of this vulnerability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Direct Token Optimization: A Self-contained Approach to Large Language Model Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00125v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning is an emerging technique that removes the influence of a subset of training data (forget set) from a model without full retraining, with applications including privacy protection, content moderation, and model correction. The key challenge lies in ensuring that the model completely forgets the knowledge of the forget set without compromising its overall utility. Existing unlearning methods for large language models (LLMs) often utilize auxiliary language models, retain datasets, or even commercial AI services for effective unlearning and maintaining the model utility. However, dependence on these external resources is often impractical and could potentially introduce additional privacy risks. In this work, we propose direct token optimization (DTO), a novel self-contained unlearning approach for LLMs that directly optimizes the token level objectives and eliminates the need for external resources. Given a sequence to unlearn, we identify two categories of tokens: target tokens, which capture critical knowledge for unlearning, and the remaining non-target tokens, which are crucial for maintaining the model utility. The former are used to optimize the unlearning objective, while the latter serve to preserve the model's performance. The experimental results show that the proposed DTO achieves up to 16.8$\times$ improvement in forget quality on several benchmark datasets than the latest baselines while maintaining a comparable level of model utility.</p></details> |  |

Indexed containers generalize this notion to better fit the scope of dependently typed programming. When interpreting types to be sets, a container describes an endofunctor on the category of sets while an I-indexed container describes an endofunctor on the category Set^I of I-indexed families of sets. We consider the monoidal structure on the category of I-indexed containers whose tensor product of containers describes the composition of the respective induced endofunctors. We then give a combinatorial characterization of monoids in this monoidal category, and we show how these monoids correspond precisely to monads on the induced endofunctors on Set^I. Lastly, we conclude by presenting some examples of monads on Set^I that fall under our characterization, including the product of two monads, indexed variants of the state and the writer monads and an example of a free monad. The technical results of this work are accompanied by a formalization in the proof assistant Cubical Agda.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings LSFA 2025, arXiv:2509.23739</p></details> |

The cloud-based deployment provides on-demand availability without active management. More recently, the concept of cloud-native application has been proposed and represents an invaluable step toward helping organizations develop software faster and update it more frequently to achieve dramatic business outcomes. Cloud-native is an approach to build and run applications that exploit the cloud computing delivery model's advantages. It is more about how applications are created and deployed than where. The container-based virtualization technology, such as Docker and Kubernetes, serves as the foundation for cloud-native applications. This paper investigates the performance of two popular computational-intensive applications, big data, and deep learning, in a cloud-native environment. We analyze the system overhead and resource usage for these applications. Through extensive experiments, we show that the completion time reduces by up to 79.4% by changing the default setting and increases by up to 96.7% due to different resource management schemes on two platforms. Additionally, the resource release is delayed by up to 116.7% across different systems. Our work can guide developers, administrators, and researchers to better design and deploy their applications by selecting and configuring a hosting platform.</p></details> | under review |

This makes it difficult to specify container APIs that temporarily expose those pointers to the outside, and to verify programs that use these APIs. We present logical pinning, a lightweight borrowing model for sequential programs that allows users to selectively track container-internal pointers at the logical level. Our model generalizes the magic-wand operator, making it easy to write and prove precise specifications, including pointer-stability properties. Because it only changes how representation predicates and specifications are written, our approach is compatible with most separation logic variants. We demonstrate the practicality of logical pinning by verifying small but representative pointer-manipulating programs, and deriving more precise versions of common container specifications. In doing so, we show that our approach subsumes some well-known proof patterns, simplifies some complex proofs, and enables reasoning about program patterns not supported by traditional specifications. All of our results are mechanized in the Rocq proof assistant, using the CFML library.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parameterized Hardness of Zonotope Containment and Neural Network Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22849v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks with ReLU activations are a widely used model in machine learning. It is thus important to have a profound understanding of the properties of the functions computed by such networks. Recently, there has been increasing interest in the (parameterized) computational complexity of determining these properties. In this work, we close several gaps and resolve an open problem posted by Froese et al. [COLT '25] regarding the parameterized complexity of various problems related to network verification. In particular, we prove that deciding positivity (and thus surjectivity) of a function $f\colon\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$ computed by a 2-layer ReLU network is W[1]-hard when parameterized by $d$. This result also implies that zonotope (non-)containment is W[1]-hard with respect to $d$, a problem that is of independent interest in computational geometry, control theory, and robotics. Moreover, we show that approximating the maximum within any multiplicative factor in 2-layer ReLU networks, computing the $L_p$-Lipschitz constant for $p\in(0,\infty]$ in 2-layer networks, and approximating the $L_p$-Lipschitz constant in 3-layer networks are NP-hard and W[1]-hard with respect to $d$. Notably, our hardness results are the strongest known so far and imply that the naive enumeration-based methods for solving these fundamental problems are all essentially optimal under the Exponential Time Hypothesis.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |

To address the issues of distributed decisions in cloud-edge environments, we present TD3-Sched, a distributed reinforcement learning (DRL) scheduler based on Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) for continuous control of CPU and memory allocation, which can achieve optimized decisions for resource provisioning under dynamic workloads. On a realistic cloud-edge testbed with SockShop application and Alibaba traces, TD3-Sched achieves reductions of 17.9% to 38.6% in latency under same loads compared with other reinforcement-learning and rule-based baselines, and 16% to 31.6% under high loads. TD3-Sched also shows superior Service Level Objective (SLO) compliance with only 0.47% violations. These results indicate faster convergence, lower latency, and more stable performance while preserving service quality in container-based cloud-edge environment compared with the baselines.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

While cutting-edge methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excel in typical scenes, their performance deteriorates in the presence of mirrors. Existing solutions mainly focus on handling mirror surfaces through symmetry mapping but often overlook the rich information carried by mirror reflections. These reflections offer complementary perspectives that can fill in absent details and significantly enhance reconstruction quality. To advance 3D reconstruction in mirror-rich environments, we present MirrorScene3D, a comprehensive dataset featuring diverse indoor scenes, 1256 high-quality images, and annotated mirror masks, providing a benchmark for evaluating reconstruction methods in reflective settings. Building on this, we propose ReflectiveGS, an extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting that utilizes mirror reflections as complementary viewpoints rather than simple symmetry artifacts, enhancing scene geometry and recovering absent details. Experiments on MirrorScene3D show that ReflectiveGaussian outperforms existing methods in SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, and training speed, setting a new benchmark for 3D reconstruction in mirror-rich environments.</p></details> |  |

Yet, while containers simplify software management, they face significant performance challenges in HPC environments as they must sacrifice hardware-specific optimizations to achieve portability. Although HPC containers can use runtime hooks to access optimized MPI libraries and GPU devices, they are limited by application binary interface (ABI) compatibility and cannot overcome the effects of early-stage compilation decisions. Acceleration as a Service (XaaS) proposes a vision of performance-portable containers, where a containerized application should achieve peak performance across all HPC systems. We present a practical realization of this vision through Source and Intermediate Representation (IR) containers, where we delay performance-critical decisions until the target system specification is known. We analyze specialization mechanisms in HPC software and propose a new LLM-assisted method for automatic discovery of specializations. By examining the compilation pipeline, we develop a methodology to build containers optimized for target architectures at deployment time. Our prototype demonstrates that new XaaS containers combine the convenience of containerization with the performance benefits of system-specialized builds.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis (SC'25)</p></details> |
| **[A High-performance Real-time Container File Monitoring Approach Based on Virtual Machine Introspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16030v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As cloud computing continues to advance and become an integral part of modern IT infrastructure, container security has emerged as a critical factor in ensuring the smooth operation of cloud-native applications. An attacker can attack the service in the container or even perform the container escape attack by tampering with the files. Monitoring container files is important for APT detection and cyberspace security. Existing file monitoring methods are usually based on host operating system or virtual machine introspection to protect file security in real time. The methods based on the host operating system usually monitor file operations in the host operating system. However, when the container escapes to the host, the host operating system will no longer be secure, so these methods face the problem of weak security. Aiming at the problems of low security and high overload introduced in existing container file monitoring, a high-performance container file monitoring method based on virtual machine introspection is proposed. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively monitor the container files and introduce an acceptable monitoring overload.</p></details> |  |

We know that, for CQAC queries, the problem of testing containment is $Π_2 ^p$ -complete. However, there are broad classes of queries with semi-interval arithmetic comparisons in the containing query that render the problem solvable in NP. In all cases examined the contained query is allowed to be any CQAC. Interestingly, we also prove that there are simple cases where the problem remains $Π_2 ^p$ -complete. We also investigate the complexity of computing certain answers in the framework of answering CQAC queries with semi-interval comparisons using any CQAC views. We prove that maximally contained rewritings in the language of union of CQACs always compute exactly all certain answers. We find cases where we can compute certain answers in polynomial time using maximally contained rewritings.</p></details> | 71 pages 2 figures |
| **[Dstack: A Zero Trust Framework for Confidential Containers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11555v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Web3 applications require execution platforms that maintain confidentiality and integrity without relying on centralized trust authorities. While Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) offer promising capabilities for confidential computing, current implementations face significant limitations when applied to Web3 contexts, particularly in security reliability, censorship resistance, and vendor independence. This paper presents dstack, a comprehensive framework that transforms raw TEE technology into a true Zero Trust platform. We introduce three key innovations: (1) Portable Confidential Containers that enable seamless workload migration across heterogeneous TEE environments while maintaining security guarantees, (2) Decentralized Code Management that leverages smart contracts for transparent governance of TEE applications, and (3) Verifiable Domain Management that ensures secure and verifiable application identity without centralized authorities. These innovations are implemented through three core components: dstack-OS, dstack-KMS, and dstack-Gateway. Together, they demonstrate how to achieve both the performance advantages of VM-level TEE solutions and the trustless guarantees required by Web3 applications. Our evaluation shows that dstack provides comprehensive security guarantees while maintaining practical usability for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring and Exploiting the Resource Isolation Attack Surface of WebAssembly Containers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11242v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the WebAssembly (or Wasm) technology has been rapidly evolving, with many runtimes actively under development, providing cross-platform secure sandboxes for Wasm modules to run as portable containers. Compared with Docker, which isolates applications at the operating system level, Wasm runtimes provide more security mechanisms, such as linear memory, type checking, and protected call stacks. Although Wasm is designed with security in mind and considered to be a more secure container runtime, various security challenges have arisen, and researchers have focused on the security of Wasm runtimes, such as discovering vulnerabilities or proposing new security mechanisms to achieve robust isolation. However, we have observed that the resource isolation is not well protected by the current Wasm runtimes, and attackers can exhaust the host's resources to interfere with the execution of other container instances by exploiting the WASI/WASIX interfaces. And the attack surface has not been well explored and measured. In this paper, we explore the resource isolation attack surface of Wasm runtimes systematically by proposing several static Wasm runtime analysis approaches. Based on the analysis results, we propose several exploitation strategies to break the resource isolation of Wasm runtimes. The experimental results show that malicious Wasm instances can not only consume large amounts of system resources on their own but also introduce high workloads into other components of the underlying operating system, leading to a substantial performance degradation of the whole system. In addition, the mitigation approaches have also been discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 2 figures.

| **[ORCA: Unveiling Obscure Containers In The Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09322v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software development increasingly depends on open-source libraries and third-party components, which are often encapsulated into containerized environments. While improving the development and deployment of applications, this approach introduces security risks, particularly when outdated or vulnerable components are inadvertently included in production environments. Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is a critical process that helps identify and manage packages and dependencies inside a container. However, unintentional modifications to the container filesystem can lead to incomplete container images, which compromise the reliability of SCA tools. In this paper, we examine the limitations of both cloud-based and open-source SCA tools when faced with such obscure images. An analysis of 600 popular containers revealed that obscure containers exist in well-known registries and trusted images and that many tools fail to analyze such containers. To mitigate these issues, we propose an obscuration-resilient methodology for container analysis and introduce ORCA (Obscuration-Resilient Container Analyzer), its open-source implementation. We reported our findings to all vendors using their appropriate channels. Our results demonstrate that ORCA effectively detects the content of obscure containers and achieves a median 40% improvement in file coverage compared to Docker Scout and Syft.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unikernels vs. Containers: A Runtime-Level Performance Comparison for Resource-Constrained Edge Workloads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07891v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The choice between containers and unikernels is a critical trade-off for edge applications, balancing the container's ecosystem maturity against unikernel's specialized efficiency. However, until now, how this trade-off behaves under the severe memory constraints of industrial edge environments remains insufficiently investigated, especially across different execution models. This work presents an empirical comparison using Go and Node.js applications, representing ahead-of-time (AOT) and just-in-time (JIT) compilation, respectively. While unikernels consistently deliver faster startup times and outperform containers for Go-based workloads in resource-constrained environments, the evaluation results identify a critical performance crossover for Node.js. Below a certain memory threshold, Docker containers maintain stable performance for both I/O-bound and CPU-bound applications, while the Nanos unikernel's performance degrades sharply. This reveals that Linux's memory management capabilities can outweigh the minimalist efficiency of unikernels under resource scarcity, a critical trade-off that, until now, has not been adequately quantified for JIT runtimes in this context. These findings demonstrate that the optimal deployment paradigm depends on both runtime behavior and available system resources, underscoring the need for workload-aware deployment strategies in edge computing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Verifying Correctness of PLC Software during System Evolution using Model Containment Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05596v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Upgradation of Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) software is quite common to accommodate evolving industrial requirements. Verifying the correctness of such upgrades remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a verification-based approach to ensure the correctness of the existing functionality in the upgraded version of a PLC software. The method converts the older and the newer versions of the sequential function chart (SFC) into two Petri net models. We then verify whether one model is contained within another, based on a novel containment checking algorithm grounded in symbolic path equivalence. For this purpose, we have developed a home-grown Petri net-based containment checker. Experimental evaluation on 80 real-world benchmarks from the OSCAT library highlights the scalability and effectiveness of the framework. We have compared our approach with verifAPS, a popular tool used for software upgradation, and observed nearly 4x performance improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages with appendix</p></details> |
| **[Robust Containment Queries over Collections of Trimmed NURBS Surfaces via Generalized Winding Numbers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11435v2)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a containment query that is robust to the watertightness of regions bound by trimmed NURBS surfaces, as this property is difficult to guarantee for in-the-wild CAD models. Containment is determined through the generalized winding number (GWN), a mathematical construction that is indifferent to the arrangement of surfaces in the shape. Applying contemporary techniques for the 3D GWN to trimmed NURBS surfaces requires some form of geometric discretization, introducing computational inefficiency to the algorithm and even risking containment misclassifications near the surface. In contrast, our proposed method uses a novel reformulation of the relevant surface integral based on Stokes' theorem, which operates on the boundary and trimming curves as provided through rapidly converging adaptive quadrature. Batches of queries are further accelerated by memoizing (i.e.\ caching and reusing) quadrature node positions and tangents as they are evaluated. We demonstrate that our GWN method is robust to complex trimming geometry in a CAD model, and is accurate up to arbitrary precision at arbitrary distances from the surface. The derived containment query is therefore robust to model non-watertightness while respecting all curved features of the input shape.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 Pa...</summary><p>18 Pages, 16 Figures, 1 Table</p></details> |
| **[Characterizing Trust Boundary Vulnerabilities in TEE Containers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20962v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) have emerged as a cornerstone of confidential computing, garnering significant attention from both academia and industry. To enable the secure development, execution, and deployment, of applications on TEE platforms, TEE containers have been introduced as middleware solutions. These containers aim to shield applications from potentially malicious operating systems and orchestration interfaces while maintaining usability and reliability. In this paper, we analyze the isolation strategies employed by existing TEE containers to protect secure applications. To address the challenges in analyzing these interfaces, we designed an automated analyzer to precisely identify and evaluate their isolation boundaries. We observed that some TEE containers fail to achieve their intended goals due to critical design and implementation flaws, such as information leakage, rollback attacks, denial-of-service, and Iago attacks, which pose significant security risks. Drawing from our findings, we share key lessons to guide the development of more secure container solutions and discuss emerging trends in TEE containerization design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Navigating Demand Uncertainty in Container Shipping: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Enabling Adaptive and Feasible Master Stowage Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12756v5)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in solving various combinatorial optimization problems. However, conventional RL faces challenges when dealing with complex, real-world constraints, especially when action space feasibility is explicit and dependent on the corresponding state or trajectory. In this work, we address stochastic sequential dynamic decision-making problems with state-dependent constraints. As a relevant and real-world case study, we focus on the master stowage planning problem in container shipping, which aims to optimize revenue and operational costs under demand uncertainty and operational constraints. We propose a deep RL framework with an encoder-decoder model and feasibility layers that satisfy convex constraints and maintain unbiased gradient flow, which embed problem instances, current solutions, and demand uncertainty to guide learning. Experiments show that our model efficiently finds adaptive, feasible solutions that generalize across varying distributions and scale to larger instances, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in constrained RL and stochastic programming. By uniting artificial intelligence and operations research, our policy empowers humans to make adaptive, uncertainty-aware decisions for resilient and sustainable planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review</p></details> |
| **[Predictive Machine Learning to Increase the Throughput of Container Yards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16207v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study seeks to improve the throughput rates for shipping container terminals. In the United States, shipping ports link the domestic economy to global markets and are vital to sustain supply chain flow and economic stability. Maritime shipping accounts for nearly half of the U.S.'s annual international trade, two thirds of which are represented by container shipping. Previous studies highlighted the capability of automation in enhancing container processing; however, unlike in European and East Asian ports, full automation is limited in U.S. ports due to legal protections for human labor. Consequently, there is a need for alternative methods that deliver automation level efficiencies while maintaining the terms of cooperative agreements. This paper proposes an Intelligent Planning System (IPS) that applies the concept of Pareto Optimization to container yards through a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) based recursive appointment system. The results show an improvement from baseline for both daily terminal throughput volumes and processing times. The generated IPS can be employed to provide recommendations for container positioning and truck pickup appointments to optimize container yard layout and flow resulting in reduced realtime congestion and predictively mitigated future congestion.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[Using Containers to Speed Up Development, to Run Integration Tests and to Teach About Distributed Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21464v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GlideinWMS is a workload manager provisioning resources for many experiments, including CMS and DUNE. The software is distributed both as native packages and specialized production containers. Following an approach used in other communities like web development, we built our workspaces, system-like containers to ease development and testing. Developers can change the source tree or check out a different branch and quickly reconfigure the services to see the effect of their changes. In this paper, we will talk about what differentiates workspaces from other containers. We will describe our base system, composed of three containers: a one-node cluster including a compute element and a batch system, a GlideinWMS Factory controlling pilot jobs, and a scheduler and Frontend to submit jobs and provision resources. Additional containers can be used for optional components. This system can easily run on a laptop, and we will share our evaluation of different container runtimes, with an eye for ease of use and performance. Finally, we will talk about our experience as developers and with students. The GlideinWMS workspaces are easily integrated with IDEs like VS Code, simplifying debugging and allowing development and testing of the system even when offline. They simplified the training and onboarding of new team members and summer interns. And they were useful in workshops where students could have first-hand experience with the mechanisms and components that, in production, run millions of jobs.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, for associated code, see [this https URL](https://github.com/glideinWMS/containers), to be published in proceedings of 27th International Conference on Computing in High Energy and Nuclear Physics (CHEP 2024). 21-25 October 2024.

| **[Learning to See Inside Opaque Liquid Containers using Speckle Vibrometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20757v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer vision seeks to infer a wide range of information about objects and events. However, vision systems based on conventional imaging are limited to extracting information only from the visible surfaces of scene objects. For instance, a vision system can detect and identify a Coke can in the scene, but it cannot determine whether the can is full or empty. In this paper, we aim to expand the scope of computer vision to include the novel task of inferring the hidden liquid levels of opaque containers by sensing the tiny vibrations on their surfaces. Our method provides a first-of-a-kind way to inspect the fill level of multiple sealed containers remotely, at once, without needing physical manipulation and manual weighing. First, we propose a novel speckle-based vibration sensing system for simultaneously capturing scene vibrations on a 2D grid of points. We use our system to efficiently and remotely capture a dataset of vibration responses for a variety of everyday liquid containers. Then, we develop a transformer-based approach for analyzing the captured vibrations and classifying the container type and its hidden liquid level at the time of measurement. Our architecture is invariant to the vibration source, yielding correct liquid level estimates for controlled and ambient scene sound sources. Moreover, our model generalizes to unseen container instances within known classes (e.g., training on five Coke cans of a six-pack, testing on a sixth) and fluid levels. We demonstrate our method by recovering liquid levels from various everyday containers.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[Sampling-Based Estimation of Jaccard Containment and Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10019v3)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of estimating the containment and similarity between two sets using only random samples from each set, without relying on sketches of full sets. The study introduces a binomial model for predicting the overlap between samples, demonstrating that it is both accurate and practical when sample sizes are small compared to the original sets. The paper compares this model to previous approaches and shows that it provides better estimates under the considered conditions. It also analyzes the statistical properties of the estimator, including error bounds and sample size requirements needed to achieve a desired level of accuracy and confidence. The framework is extended to estimate set similarity, and the paper provides guidance for applying these methods in large scale data systems where only partial or sampled data is available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Formalising Inductive and Coinductive Containers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02603v5)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Containers capture the concept of strictly positive data types in programming. The original development of containers is done in the internal language of locally cartesian closed categories (LCCCs) with disjoint coproducts and W-types, and uniqueness of identity proofs (UIP) is implicitly assumed throughout. Although it is claimed that these developments can also be interpreted in extensional Martin-Löf type theory, this interpretation is not made explicit. In this paper, we present a formalisation of the results that 'containers preserve least and greatest fixed points' in Cubical Agda, thereby giving a formulation in intensional type theory. Our proofs do not make use of UIP and thereby generalise the original results from talking about container functors on Set to container functors on the wild category of types. Our main incentive for using Cubical Agda is that its path type restores the equivalence between bisimulation and coinductive equality. Thus, besides developing container theory in a more general setting, we also demonstrate the usefulness of Cubical Agda's path type to coinductive proofs.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages main text.

Not-contains is practically relevant, for instance in symbolic execution of string manipulating programs. Particularly, we show that the predicate $\neg\mathit{Contains}(x_1 \ldots x_n, y_1 \ldots y_m)$, where $x_1 \ldots x_n$ and $y_1 \ldots y_m$ are sequences of string variables constrained by regular languages, is decidable. Decidability of a not-contains predicate combined with chain-free word equations and regular membership constraints follows.</p></details> |  |

A typical service life for a container is more than 20 years. However, overtime containers suffer various types of damage due to the mechanical as well as natural factors. A damaged container is a safety hazard for the employees handling it and a liability for the logistic company. Therefore, a timely inspection and detection of the damaged container is a key for prolonging service life as well as avoiding safety hazards. In this paper, we will compare the performance of the damage detection by three state-of-the-art advanced computer vision models Yolov12, Yolov11 and RF-DETR. We will use a dataset of 278 annotated images to train, validate and test the model. We will compare the mAP and precision of the model. The objective of this paper is to identify the model that is best suited for container damage detection. The result is mixed. mAP@50 score of Yolov11 and 12 was 81.9% compared to RF-DETR, which was 77.7%. However, while testing the model for not-so-common damaged containers, the RF-DETR model outperformed the others overall, exhibiting superiority to accurately detecting both damaged containers as well as damage occurrences with high confidence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributive Laws of Monadic Containers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17191v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Containers are used to carve out a class of strictly positive data types in terms of shapes and positions. They can be interpreted via a fully-faithful functor into endofunctors on Set. Monadic containers are those containers whose interpretation as a Set functor carries a monad structure. The category of containers is closed under container composition and is a monoidal category, whereas monadic containers do not in general compose. In this paper, we develop a characterisation of distributive laws of monadic containers. Distributive laws were introduced as a sufficient condition for the composition of the underlying functors of two monads to also carry a monad structure. Our development parallels Ahman and Uustalu's characterisation of distributive laws of directed containers, i.e. containers whose Set functor interpretation carries a comonad structure. Furthermore, by combining our work with theirs, we construct characterisations of mixed distributive laws (i.e. of directed containers over monadic containers and vice versa), thereby completing the 'zoo' of container characterisations of (co)monads and their distributive laws. We have found these characterisations amenable to development of existence and uniqueness proofs of distributive laws, particularly in the mechanised setting of Cubical Agda, in which most of the theory of this paper has been formalised.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages main text, 4 pages appendices.
