| **[Cross-Chain Sealed-Bid Auctions Using Confidential Compute Blockchains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19491v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sealed-bid auctions ensure fair competition and efficient allocation but are often deployed on centralized infrastructure, enabling opaque manipulation. Public blockchains eliminate central control, yet their inherent transparency conflicts with the confidentiality required for sealed bidding. Prior attempts struggle to reconcile privacy, verifiability, and scalability without relying on trusted intermediaries, multi-round protocols, or expensive cryptography. We present a sealed-bid auction protocol that executes sensitive bidding logic on a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)-backed confidential compute blockchain while retaining settlement and enforcement on a public chain. Bidders commit funds to enclave-generated escrow addresses, ensuring confidentiality and binding commitments. After the deadline, any party can trigger resolution: the confidential blockchain determines the winner through verifiable off-chain computation and issues signed settlement transactions for execution on the public chain. Our design provides security, privacy, and scalability without trusted third parties or protocol modifications. We implement it on SUAVE with Ethereum settlement, evaluate its scalability and trust assumptions, and demonstrate deployment with minimal integration on existing infrastructure</p></details> |  |

| **[GeoFF: Federated Serverless Workflows with Data Pre-Fetching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13594v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is a popular cloud computing model in which applications are implemented as work flows of multiple independent functions. While cloud providers usually offer composition services for such workflows, they do not support cross-platform workflows forcing developers to hardcode the composition logic. Furthermore, FaaS workflows tend to be slow due to cascading cold starts, inter-function latency, and data download latency on the critical path. In this paper, we propose GeoFF, a serverless choreography middleware that executes FaaS workflows across different public and private FaaS platforms, including ad-hoc workflow recomposition. Furthermore, GeoFF supports function pre-warming and data pre-fetching. This minimizes end-to-end workflow latency by taking cold starts and data download latency off the critical path. In experiments with our proof-of-concept prototype and a realistic application, we were able to reduce end-to-end latency by more than 50%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Serverless GPU Architecture for Enterprise HR Analytics: A Production-Scale BDaaS Implementation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19689v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial and government organizations increasingly depend on data-driven analytics for workforce, finance, and regulated decision processes, where timeliness, cost efficiency, and compliance are critical. Distributed frameworks such as Spark and Flink remain effective for massive-scale batch or streaming analytics but introduce coordination complexity and auditing overheads that misalign with moderate-scale, latency-sensitive inference. Meanwhile, cloud providers now offer serverless GPUs, and models such as TabNet enable interpretable tabular ML, motivating new deployment blueprints for regulated environments. In this paper, we present a production-oriented Big Data as a Service (BDaaS) blueprint that integrates a single-node serverless GPU runtime with TabNet. The design leverages GPU acceleration for throughput, serverless elasticity for cost reduction, and feature-mask interpretability for IL4/FIPS compliance. We conduct benchmarks on the HR, Adult, and BLS datasets, comparing our approach against Spark and CPU baselines. Our results show that GPU pipelines achieve up to 4.5x higher throughput, 98x lower latency, and 90% lower cost per 1K inferences compared to Spark baselines, while compliance mechanisms add only ~5.7 ms latency with p99 < 22 ms. Interpretability remains stable under peak load, ensuring reliable auditability. Taken together, these findings provide a compliance-aware benchmark, a reproducible Helm-packaged blueprint, and a decision framework that demonstrate the practicality of secure, interpretable, and cost-efficient serverless GPU analytics for regulated enterprise and government settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables.

| **[The Hidden Dangers of Public Serverless Repositories: An Empirical Security Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17311v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing has rapidly emerged as a prominent cloud paradigm, enabling developers to focus solely on application logic without the burden of managing servers or underlying infrastructure. Public serverless repositories have become key to accelerating the development of serverless applications. However, their growing popularity makes them attractive targets for adversaries. Despite this, the security posture of these repositories remains largely unexplored, exposing developers and organizations to potential risks. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive analysis of the security landscape of serverless components hosted in public repositories. We analyse 2,758 serverless components from five widely used public repositories popular among developers and enterprises, and 125,936 Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates across three widely used IaC frameworks. Our analysis reveals systemic vulnerabilities including outdated software packages, misuse of sensitive parameters, exploitable deployment configurations, susceptibility to typo-squatting attacks and opportunities to embed malicious behaviour within compressed serverless components. Finally, we provide practical recommendations to mitigate these threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ESORICS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Object as a Service: Simplifying Cloud-Native Development through Serverless Object Abstraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04898v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The function-as-a-service (FaaS) paradigm is envisioned as the next generation of cloud computing systems that mitigate the burden for cloud-native application developers by abstracting them from cloud resource management. However, it does not deal with the application data aspects. As such, developers have to intervene and undergo the burden of managing the application data, often via separate cloud storage services. To further streamline cloud-native application development, in this work, we propose a new paradigm, known as Object as a Service (OaaS) that encapsulates application data and functions into the cloud object abstraction. OaaS relieves developers from resource and data management burden while offering built-in optimization features. Inspired by OOP, OaaS incorporates access modifiers and inheritance into the serverless paradigm that: (a) prevents developers from compromising the system via accidentally accessing underlying data; and (b) enables software reuse in cloud-native application development. Furthermore, OaaS natively supports dataflow semantics. It enables developers to define function workflows while transparently handling data navigation, synchronization, and parallelism issues. To establish the OaaS paradigm, we develop a platform named Oparaca that offers state abstraction for structured and unstructured data with consistency and fault-tolerant guarantees. We evaluated Oparaca under real-world settings against state-of-the-art platforms with respect to the imposed overhead, scalability, and ease of use. The results demonstrate that the object abstraction provided by OaaS can streamline flexible and scalable cloud-native application development with an insignificant overhead on the underlying serverless system.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlexPipe: Adapting Dynamic LLM Serving Through Inflight Pipeline Refactoring in Fragmented Serverless Clusters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11938v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) in production faces significant challenges from highly variable request patterns and severe resource fragmentation in serverless clusters. Current systems rely on static pipeline configurations that struggle to adapt to dynamic workload conditions, leading to substantial inefficiencies. We present FlexPipe, a novel system that dynamically reconfigures pipeline architectures during runtime to address these fundamental limitations. FlexPipe decomposes models into fine-grained stages and intelligently adjusts pipeline granularity based on real-time request pattern analysis, implementing three key innovations: fine-grained model partitioning with preserved computational graph constraints, inflight pipeline refactoring with consistent cache transitions, and topology-aware resource allocation that navigates GPU fragmentation. Comprehensive evaluation on an 82-GPU cluster demonstrates that FlexPipe achieves up to 8.5x better resource efficiency while maintaining 38.3% lower latency compared to state-of-the-art systems, reducing GPU reservation requirements from 75% to 30% of peak capacity.</p></details> | EuroSys 26 |
| **[Multi-Event Triggers for Serverless Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21199v3)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is an event-driven serverless cloud computing model in which small, stateless functions are invoked in response to events, such as HTTP requests, new database entries, or messages. Current FaaS platform assume that each function invocation corresponds to a single event. However, from an application perspective, it is desirable to invoke functions in response to a collection of events of different types or only with every n\textsuperscript{th} event. To implement this today, a function would need additional state management, e.g., in a database, and custom logic to determine whether its trigger condition is fulfilled and the actual application code should run. In such an implementation, most function invocations would be rendered essentially useless, leading to unnecessarily high resource usage, latency, and cost for applications. In this paper, we introduce multi-event triggers, through which complex conditions for function invocations can be specified. Specifically, we introduce abstractions for invoking functions based on a set of $n$ events and joins of multiple events of different types. This enables application developers to define intricate conditions for function invocations, workflow steps, and complex event processing. Our evaluation with a proof-of-concept prototype shows that this reduces event--invocation latency by 62.5\% in an incident detection use-case and that our system can handle more than 300,000 requests per second on limited hardware, which is sufficient load for implementation in large FaaS platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publishing at IC2E'25</p></details> |
| **[Towards Energy-Efficient Serverless Computing with Hardware Isolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08180v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing provides just-in-time infrastructure provisioning with rapid elasticity and a finely-grained pricing model. As full control of resource allocation is in the hands of the cloud provider and applications only consume resources when they actually perform work, we believe that serverless computing is uniquely positioned to maximize energy efficiency. However, the focus of current serverless platforms is to run hundreds or thousands of serverless functions from different tenants on traditional server hardware, requiring expensive software isolation mechanisms and a high degree of overprovisioning, i.e., idle servers, to anticipate load spikes. With shared caches, high clock frequencies, and many-core architectures, servers today are optimized for large, singular workloads but not to run thousands of isolated functions. We propose rethinking the serverless hardware architecture to align it with the requirements of serverless software. Specifically, we propose using hardware isolation with individual processors per function instead of software isolation resulting in a serverless hardware stack that consumes energy only when an application actually performs work. In preliminary evaluation with real hardware and a typical serverless workload we find that this could reduce energy consumption overheads by 90.63% or an average 70.8MW.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Cosmic AI Inference using Cloud Serverless Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06249v3)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale astronomical image data processing and prediction are essential for astronomers, providing crucial insights into celestial objects, the universe's history, and its evolution. While modern deep learning models offer high predictive accuracy, they often demand substantial computational resources, making them resource-intensive and limiting accessibility. We introduce the Cloud-based Astronomy Inference (CAI) framework to address these challenges. This scalable solution integrates pre-trained foundation models with serverless cloud infrastructure through a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS). CAI enables efficient and scalable inference on astronomical images without extensive hardware. Using a foundation model for redshift prediction as a case study, our extensive experiments cover user devices, HPC (High-Performance Computing) servers, and Cloud. Using redshift prediction with the AstroMAE model demonstrated CAI's scalability and efficiency, achieving inference on a 12.6 GB dataset in only 28 seconds compared to 140.8 seconds on HPC GPUs and 1793 seconds on HPC CPUs. CAI also achieved significantly higher throughput, reaching 18.04 billion bits per second (bps), and maintained near-constant inference times as data sizes increased, all at minimal computational cost (under $5 per experiment). We also process large-scale data up to 1 TB to show CAI's effectiveness at scale. CAI thus provides a highly scalable, accessible, and cost-effective inference solution for the astronomy community. The code is accessible at https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/AI-for-Astronomy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Function Configuration and its Management in Serverless Computing: A Taxonomy and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02404v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The serverless cloud computing model offers a framework where the service provider abstracts the underlying infrastructure management from developers. In this serverless model, FaaS provides an event-driven, function-oriented computing service characterised by fine-grained, usage-based pricing that eliminates cost for idle resources. Platforms like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Cloud Run Functions require developers to configure their function(s) with minimum operational resources for its successful execution. This resource allocation influences both the operational expense and the performance quality of these functions. However, a noticeable lack of platform transparency forces developers to rely on expert knowledge or experience-based ad-hoc decisions to request desired function resources. This makes optimal resource configuration a non-trivial task while adhering to performance constraints. Furthermore, while commercial platforms often scale resources like CPU and network bandwidth proportional to memory, open-source frameworks permit independent configuration of function resources, introducing additional complexity for developers aiming to optimise their functions. These complexities have directed researchers to resolve developer challenges and advance towards an efficient server-less execution model. In this article, we identify different aspects of resource configuration techniques in FaaS settings and propose a taxonomy of factors that influence function design, configuration, run-time cost, and performance guarantees. We conduct an analysis of existing literature on resource configuration to present a comprehensive review of current studies on function configuration. We also identify existing research gaps and suggest future research directions to enhance function configuration and strengthen the capabilities of serverless computing environments to drive its broader adoption.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables, journal</p></details> |
| **[Lumos: Performance Characterization of WebAssembly as a Serverless Runtime in the Edge-Cloud Continuum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05118v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>WebAssembly has emerged as a lightweight and portable runtime to execute serverless functions, particularly in heterogeneous and resource-constrained environments such as the Edge Cloud Continuum. However, the performance benefits versus trade-offs remain insufficiently understood. This paper presents Lumos, a performance model and benchmarking tool for characterizing serverless runtimes. Lumos identifies workload, system, and environment-level performance drivers in the Edge-Cloud Continuum. We benchmark state-of-the-art containers and the Wasm runtime in interpreted mode and with ahead-of-time compilation. Our performance characterization shows that AoT-compiled Wasm images are up to 30x smaller and decrease cold-start latency by up to 16% compared to containers, while interpreted Wasm suffers up to 55x higher warm latency and up to 10x I/O-serialization overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demystifying Serverless Costs on Public Platforms: Bridging Billing, Architecture, and OS Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01283v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Public cloud serverless platforms have attracted a large user base due to their high scalability, plug-and-play deployment model, and pay-per-use billing. However, compared to virtual machines and container hosting services, modern serverless offerings typically impose higher per-unit time and resource charges. Additionally, billing practices such as wall-clock time allocation-based billing, invocation fees, and usage rounding up can further increase costs. This work, for the first time, holistically demystifies these costs by conducting an in-depth, top-down characterization and analysis from user-facing billing models, through request serving architectures, and down to operating system scheduling on major public serverless platforms. We quantify, for the first time, how current billing practices inflate billable resources up to 4.35x beyond actual consumption. Also, our analysis reveals previously unreported cost drivers, such as operational patterns of serving architectures that create overheads, details of resource allocation during keep-alive periods, and OS scheduling granularity effects that directly impact both performance and billing. By tracing the sources of costs from billing models down to OS scheduling, we uncover the rationale behind today's expensive serverless billing model and practices and provide insights for designing performant and cost-effective serverless systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the Proceedings of the Twenty-First European Conference on Computer Systems (EuroSys '26)</p></details> |
| **[Code once, Run Green: Automated Green Code Translation in Serverless Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22068v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid digitization and the increasing use of emerging technologies such as AI models have significantly contributed to the emissions of computing infrastructure. Efforts to mitigate this impact typically focus on the infrastructure level such as powering data centers with renewable energy, or through the specific design of energy-efficient software. However, both strategies rely on stakeholder intervention, making their adoption in legacy and already-deployed systems unlikely. As a result, past architectural and implementation decisions continue to incur additional energy usage - a phenomenon we refer to as energy debt. Hence, in this paper, we investigate the potential of serverless computing platforms to automatically reduce energy debt by leveraging the unique access to function source code. Specifically, we explore whether large language models (LLMs) can translate serverless functions into more energy-efficient programming languages while preserving functional correctness. To this end, we design and implement ReFaaS and integrate it into the Fission serverless framework. We evaluate multiple LLMs on their ability to perform such code translations and analyze their impact on energy consumption. Our preliminary results indicate that translated functions can reduce invocation energy by up to 70%, achieving net energy savings after approximately 3,000 to 5,000 invocations, depending on the LLM used. Nonetheless, the approach faces several challenges: not all functions are suitable for translation, and for some, the amortization threshold is significantly higher or unreachable. Despite these limitations, we identify four key research challenges whose resolution could unlock long-term, automated mitigation of energy debt in serverless computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IC2E 2025</p></details> |
| **[HydraServe: Minimizing Cold Start Latency for Serverless LLM Serving in Public Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15524v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the proliferation of large language model (LLM) variants, developers are turning to serverless computing for cost-efficient LLM deployment. However, public cloud providers often struggle to provide performance guarantees for serverless LLM serving due to significant cold start latency caused by substantial model sizes and complex runtime dependencies. To address this problem, we present HydraServe, a serverless LLM serving system designed to minimize cold start latency in public clouds. HydraServe proactively distributes models across servers to quickly fetch them, and overlaps cold-start stages within workers to reduce startup latency. Additionally, HydraServe strategically places workers across GPUs to avoid network contention among cold-start instances. To minimize resource consumption during cold starts, HydraServe further introduces pipeline consolidation that can merge groups of workers into individual serving endpoints. Our comprehensive evaluations under diverse settings demonstrate that HydraServe reduces the cold start latency by 1.7$\times$-- 4.7$\times$ and improves service level objective attainment by 1.43$\times$--1.74$\times$ compared to baselines.</p></details> | Accepted by NSDI'26 |
| **[Cppless: Single-Source and High-Performance Serverless Programming in C++](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10834v3)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of serverless computing introduced a new class of scalable, elastic and widely available parallel workers in the cloud. Many systems and applications benefit from offloading computations and parallel tasks to dynamically allocated resources. However, the developers of C++ applications find it difficult to integrate functions due to complex deployment, lack of compatibility between client and cloud environments, and loosely typed input and output data. To enable single-source and efficient serverless acceleration in C++, we introduce Cppless, an end-to-end framework for implementing remote functions which handles the creation, deployment, and invocation of serverless functions. Cppless is built on top of LLVM and requires only two compiler extensions to automatically extract C++ function objects and deploy them to the cloud. We demonstrate that offloading parallel computations, such as from a C++ application to serverless workers, can provide up to 59x speedup with minimal cost increase while requiring only minor code modifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of paper accepted at the ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization (TACO) journal</p></details> |
| **[Cost-Performance Analysis: A Comparative Study of CPU-Based Serverless and GPU-Based Training Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14920v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of distributed machine learning (ML) faces increasing demands for scalable and cost-effective training solutions, particularly in the context of large, complex models. Serverless computing has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these challenges by offering dynamic scalability and resource-efficient execution. Building upon our previous work, which introduced the Serverless Peer Integrated for Robust Training (SPIRT) architecture, this paper presents a comparative analysis of several serverless distributed ML architectures. We examine SPIRT alongside established architectures like ScatterReduce, AllReduce, and MLLess, focusing on key metrics such as training time efficiency, cost-effectiveness, communication overhead, and fault tolerance capabilities. Our findings reveal that SPIRT provides significant improvements in reducing training times and communication overhead through strategies such as parallel batch processing and in-database operations facilitated by RedisAI. However, traditional architectures exhibit scalability challenges and varying degrees of vulnerability to faults and adversarial attacks. The cost analysis underscores the long-term economic benefits of SPIRT despite its higher initial setup costs. This study not only highlights the strengths and limitations of current serverless ML architectures but also sets the stage for future research aimed at developing new models that combine the most effective features of existing systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[λScale: Enabling Fast Scaling for Serverless Large Language Model Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09922v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing has emerged as a compelling solution for cloud-based model inference. However, as modern large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in size, existing serverless platforms often face substantial model startup overhead. This poses a significant challenge in efficiently scaling model instances to accommodate dynamic, bursty workloads commonly observed in real-world inference services. In this paper, we introduce {\lambda}Scale, an efficient serverless inference system to achieve fast model scaling. The key idea behind {\lambda}Scale is to leverage high-speed RDMA networks between GPU nodes for fast model multicast, while enabling distributed inference execution during model transmission -- referred to as "execute-while-load". {\lambda}Scale proposes an efficient model scaling scheme, {\lambda}Pipe, which supports adaptive model multicast and dynamically constructs execution pipelines across receiving nodes for collaborative, distributed inference. Additionally, {\lambda}Scale supports efficient model management across GPU and host memory, allowing fast scaling for models across different storage tiers. Evaluation results show that {\lambda}Scale enables fast model scaling and effectively handles load spikes, achieving up to 5x tail-latency improvement and 31.3% cost reduction compared to state-of-the-art solutions on real-world LLM inference traces.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming Serverless Cold Starts Through OS Co-Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14292v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serverless computing promises fine-grained elasticity and operational simplicity, fueling widespread interest from both industry and academia. Yet this promise is undercut by the cold setart problem, where invoking a function after a period of inactivity triggers costly initialization before any work can begin. Even with today's high-speed storage, the prevailing view is that achieving sub-millisecond cold starts requires keeping state resident in memory. This paper challenges that assumption. Our analysis of existing snapshot/restore mechanisms show that OS-level limitations, not storage speed, are the real barrier to ultra-fast restores from disk. These limitations force current systems to either restore state piecemeal in a costly manner or capture too much state, leading to longer restore times and unpredictable performance. Futhermore, current memory primitives exposed by the OS make it difficult to reliably fetch data into memory and avoid costly runtime page faults. To overcome these barriers, we present Spice, an execution engine purpose-built for serverless snapshot/restore. Spice integrates directly with the OS to restore kernel state without costly replay and introduces dedicated primitives for restoring memory mappings efficiently and reliably. As a result, Spice delivers near-warm performance on cold restores from disk, reducing latency by up to 14.9x over state-of-the-art process-based systems and 10.6x over VM-based systems. This proves that high performance and memory elasticity no longer need to be a trade-off in serverless computing.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate 20 IT-LLMs on modified MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks, by systematically varying the format of option labels (alphabetic, numeric, Roman) while keeping their meaning identical under four paradigms, namely: (1) With explicit instructions, label changes cause large performance shifts (e.g., -30.45\% for Roman vs. numeric), revealing instruction-format bias. (2) Without instructions, performance drops further (up to -10.84\%) and label sensitivity intensifies, underscoring the role of explicit guidance. (3) When option contents are removed, models fail random-choice baselines except with numeric labels, suggesting weak adherence to atomic directives. (4) Three-shot exemplars yield no significant gains in robustness or fidelity, and generation analyses show persistent label errors, especially for non-numeric formats. Across model sizes, larger LLMs achieve higher accuracy but remain inconsistent in instruction adherence. These results expose the insufficiencies of current instruction-tuning paradigms and highlight the need for evaluation methods and training strategies that explicitly target atomic instruction-following.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 1 figure, 8 tables</p></details> |

In fact, they involve a large number of heterogeneous microservices that also include third-party software. As a result, security vulnerabilities are hard to identify and mitigate before they start being actively exploited by attackers. For this reason, governments have recently introduced cybersecurity regulations that require vendors to share a software bill of material (SBOM) with end users or regulators. An SBOM can be employed to identify the security vulnerabilities of a software component even without access to its source code, as long as it is accurate and interoperable across different tools. This work evaluates this issue through a comprehensive study of tools for SBOM generation and vulnerability scanning, including both open-source software and cloud services from major providers. We specifically target software containers and focus on operating system packages in Linux distributions that are widely used as base images due to their far-reaching security impact. Our findings show that the considered tools are largely incompatible, leading to inaccurate reporting and a large amount of undetected vulnerabilities. We uncover the SBOM confusion vulnerability, a byproduct of such fragmented ecosystem, where inconsistent formats prevent reliable vulnerability detection across tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Carbon-Aware Container Orchestration: Predicting Workload Energy Consumption with Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03970v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing reliance on large-scale data centers to run resource-intensive workloads has significantly increased the global carbon footprint, underscoring the need for sustainable computing solutions. While container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes help optimize workload scheduling to reduce carbon emissions, existing methods often depend on centralized machine learning models that raise privacy concerns and struggle to generalize across diverse environments. In this paper, we propose a federated learning approach for energy consumption prediction that preserves data privacy by keeping sensitive operational data within individual enterprises. By extending the Kubernetes Efficient Power Level Exporter (Kepler), our framework trains XGBoost models collaboratively across distributed clients using Flower's FedXgbBagging aggregation using a bagging strategy, eliminating the need for centralized data sharing. Experimental results on the SPECPower benchmark dataset show that our FL-based approach achieves 11.7 percent lower Mean Absolute Error compared to a centralized baseline. This work addresses the unresolved trade-off between data privacy and energy prediction efficiency in prior systems such as Kepler and CASPER and offers enterprises a viable pathway toward sustainable cloud computing without compromising operational privacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 IEEE Smart World Congress (SWC 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Container Loading and Unloading through Dual-Cycling and Dockyard Rehandle Reduction Using a Hybrid Genetic Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08534v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the NP-hard problem of optimizing container handling at ports by integrating Quay Crane Dual-Cycling (QCDC) and dockyard rehandle minimization. We realized that there are interdependencies between the unloading sequence of QCDC and the dockyard plan and propose the Quay Crane Dual Cycle - Dockyard Rehandle Genetic Algorithm (QCDC-DR-GA), a hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA) that holistically optimizes both aspects: maximizing the number of Dual Cycles (DCs) and minimizing the number of dockyard rehandles. QCDC-DR-GA employs specialized crossover and mutation strategies. Extensive experiments on various ship sizes demonstrate that QCDC-DR-GA reduces total operation time by 15-20% for large ships compared to existing methods. Statistical validation via two-tailed paired t-tests confirms significant improvements at a 5% significance level. The results underscore the inefficiency of isolated optimization and highlight the critical need for integrated algorithms in port operations. This approach increases resource utilization and operational efficiency, offering a cost-effective solution for ports to decrease turnaround times without infrastructure investments.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Benchmark Study of Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for the Container Stowage Planning Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02589v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Container stowage planning (CSPP) is a critical component of maritime transportation and terminal operations, directly affecting supply chain efficiency. Owing to its complexity, CSPP has traditionally relied on human expertise. While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been applied to CSPP, systematic benchmark comparisons across different algorithms remain limited. To address this gap, we develop a Gym environment that captures the fundamental features of CSPP and extend it to include crane scheduling in both multi-agent and single-agent formulations. Within this framework, we evaluate five RL algorithms: DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, and TRPO under multiple scenarios of varying complexity. The results reveal distinct performance gaps with increasing complexity, underscoring the importance of algorithm choice and problem formulation for CSPP. Overall, this paper benchmarks multiple RL methods for CSPP while providing a reusable Gym environment with crane scheduling, thus offering a foundation for future research and practical deployment in maritime logistics.</p></details> |  |
| **[gh0stEdit: Exploiting Layer-Based Access Vulnerability Within Docker Container Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08218v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Containerisation is a popular deployment process for application-level virtualisation using a layer-based approach. Docker is a leading provider of containerisation, and through the Docker Hub, users can supply Docker images for sharing and re-purposing popular software application containers. Using a combination of in-built inspection commands, publicly displayed image layer content, and static image scanning, Docker images are designed to ensure end users can clearly assess the content of the image before running them. In this paper we present gh0stEdit, an exploit that fundamentally undermines the integrity of Docker images and subverts the assumed trust and transparency they utilise. The use of gh0stEdit allows an attacker to maliciously edit Docker images, in a way that is not shown within the image history, hierarchy or commands. This attack can also be carried out against signed images (Docker Content Trust) without invalidating the image signature. We present a detailed case study for this exploit, and showcase how gh0stEdit is able to poison an image in a way that is not picked up through static or dynamic scanning tools. We highlight the issues in the current approach to Docker image security and trust, and expose an attack method which could potentially be exploited in the wild without being detected. To the best of our knowledge we are the first to provide detailed discussion on the exploit of this vulnerability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Direct Token Optimization: A Self-contained Approach to Large Language Model Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00125v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning is an emerging technique that removes the influence of a subset of training data (forget set) from a model without full retraining, with applications including privacy protection, content moderation, and model correction. The key challenge lies in ensuring that the model completely forgets the knowledge of the forget set without compromising its overall utility. Existing unlearning methods for large language models (LLMs) often utilize auxiliary language models, retain datasets, or even commercial AI services for effective unlearning and maintaining the model utility. However, dependence on these external resources is often impractical and could potentially introduce additional privacy risks. In this work, we propose direct token optimization (DTO), a novel self-contained unlearning approach for LLMs that directly optimizes the token level objectives and eliminates the need for external resources. Given a sequence to unlearn, we identify two categories of tokens: target tokens, which capture critical knowledge for unlearning, and the remaining non-target tokens, which are crucial for maintaining the model utility. The former are used to optimize the unlearning objective, while the latter serve to preserve the model's performance. The experimental results show that the proposed DTO achieves up to 16.8$\times$ improvement in forget quality on several benchmark datasets than the latest baselines while maintaining a comparable level of model utility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Monoid Structures on Indexed Containers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25879v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Containers represent a wide class of type constructions relevant for functional programming and (co)inductive reasoning. Indexed containers generalize this notion to better fit the scope of dependently typed programming. When interpreting types to be sets, a container describes an endofunctor on the category of sets while an I-indexed container describes an endofunctor on the category Set^I of I-indexed families of sets. We consider the monoidal structure on the category of I-indexed containers whose tensor product of containers describes the composition of the respective induced endofunctors. We then give a combinatorial characterization of monoids in this monoidal category, and we show how these monoids correspond precisely to monads on the induced endofunctors on Set^I. Lastly, we conclude by presenting some examples of monads on Set^I that fall under our characterization, including the product of two monads, indexed variants of the state and the writer monads and an example of a free monad. The technical results of this work are accompanied by a formalization in the proof assistant Cubical Agda.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings LSFA 2025, arXiv:2509.23739</p></details> |
| **[Resource Management Schemes for Cloud-Native Platforms with Computing Containers of Docker and Kubernetes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10350v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Businesses have made increasing adoption and incorporation of cloud technology into internal processes in the last decade. The cloud-based deployment provides on-demand availability without active management. More recently, the concept of cloud-native application has been proposed and represents an invaluable step toward helping organizations develop software faster and update it more frequently to achieve dramatic business outcomes. Cloud-native is an approach to build and run applications that exploit the cloud computing delivery model's advantages. It is more about how applications are created and deployed than where. The container-based virtualization technology, such as Docker and Kubernetes, serves as the foundation for cloud-native applications. This paper investigates the performance of two popular computational-intensive applications, big data, and deep learning, in a cloud-native environment. We analyze the system overhead and resource usage for these applications. Through extensive experiments, we show that the completion time reduces by up to 79.4% by changing the default setting and increases by up to 96.7% due to different resource management schemes on two platforms. Additionally, the resource release is delayed by up to 116.7% across different systems. Our work can guide developers, administrators, and researchers to better design and deploy their applications by selecting and configuring a hosting platform.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Fine-Grained Reasoning About Container-Internal Pointers with Logical Pinning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23229v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most separation logics hide container-internal pointers for modularity. This makes it difficult to specify container APIs that temporarily expose those pointers to the outside, and to verify programs that use these APIs. We present logical pinning, a lightweight borrowing model for sequential programs that allows users to selectively track container-internal pointers at the logical level. Our model generalizes the magic-wand operator, making it easy to write and prove precise specifications, including pointer-stability properties. Because it only changes how representation predicates and specifications are written, our approach is compatible with most separation logic variants. We demonstrate the practicality of logical pinning by verifying small but representative pointer-manipulating programs, and deriving more precise versions of common container specifications. In doing so, we show that our approach subsumes some well-known proof patterns, simplifies some complex proofs, and enables reasoning about program patterns not supported by traditional specifications. All of our results are mechanized in the Rocq proof assistant, using the CFML library.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parameterized Hardness of Zonotope Containment and Neural Network Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22849v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks with ReLU activations are a widely used model in machine learning. It is thus important to have a profound understanding of the properties of the functions computed by such networks. Recently, there has been increasing interest in the (parameterized) computational complexity of determining these properties. In this work, we close several gaps and resolve an open problem posted by Froese et al. [COLT '25] regarding the parameterized complexity of various problems related to network verification. In particular, we prove that deciding positivity (and thus surjectivity) of a function $f\colon\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$ computed by a 2-layer ReLU network is W[1]-hard when parameterized by $d$. This result also implies that zonotope (non-)containment is W[1]-hard with respect to $d$, a problem that is of independent interest in computational geometry, control theory, and robotics. Moreover, we show that approximating the maximum within any multiplicative factor in 2-layer ReLU networks, computing the $L_p$-Lipschitz constant for $p\in(0,\infty]$ in 2-layer networks, and approximating the $L_p$-Lipschitz constant in 3-layer networks are NP-hard and W[1]-hard with respect to $d$. Notably, our hardness results are the strongest known so far and imply that the naive enumeration-based methods for solving these fundamental problems are all essentially optimal under the Exponential Time Hypothesis.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |

To address the issues of distributed decisions in cloud-edge environments, we present TD3-Sched, a distributed reinforcement learning (DRL) scheduler based on Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) for continuous control of CPU and memory allocation, which can achieve optimized decisions for resource provisioning under dynamic workloads. On a realistic cloud-edge testbed with SockShop application and Alibaba traces, TD3-Sched achieves reductions of 17.9% to 38.6% in latency under same loads compared with other reinforcement-learning and rule-based baselines, and 16% to 31.6% under high loads. TD3-Sched also shows superior Service Level Objective (SLO) compliance with only 0.47% violations. These results indicate faster convergence, lower latency, and more stable performance while preserving service quality in container-based cloud-edge environment compared with the baselines.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

While cutting-edge methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excel in typical scenes, their performance deteriorates in the presence of mirrors. Existing solutions mainly focus on handling mirror surfaces through symmetry mapping but often overlook the rich information carried by mirror reflections. These reflections offer complementary perspectives that can fill in absent details and significantly enhance reconstruction quality. To advance 3D reconstruction in mirror-rich environments, we present MirrorScene3D, a comprehensive dataset featuring diverse indoor scenes, 1256 high-quality images, and annotated mirror masks, providing a benchmark for evaluating reconstruction methods in reflective settings. Building on this, we propose ReflectiveGS, an extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting that utilizes mirror reflections as complementary viewpoints rather than simple symmetry artifacts, enhancing scene geometry and recovering absent details. Experiments on MirrorScene3D show that ReflectiveGaussian outperforms existing methods in SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, and training speed, setting a new benchmark for 3D reconstruction in mirror-rich environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[XaaS Containers: Performance-Portable Representation With Source and IR Containers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17914v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-performance computing (HPC) systems and cloud data centers are converging, and containers are becoming the default method of portable software deployment. Yet, while containers simplify software management, they face significant performance challenges in HPC environments as they must sacrifice hardware-specific optimizations to achieve portability. Although HPC containers can use runtime hooks to access optimized MPI libraries and GPU devices, they are limited by application binary interface (ABI) compatibility and cannot overcome the effects of early-stage compilation decisions. Acceleration as a Service (XaaS) proposes a vision of performance-portable containers, where a containerized application should achieve peak performance across all HPC systems. We present a practical realization of this vision through Source and Intermediate Representation (IR) containers, where we delay performance-critical decisions until the target system specification is known. We analyze specialization mechanisms in HPC software and propose a new LLM-assisted method for automatic discovery of specializations. By examining the compilation pipeline, we develop a methodology to build containers optimized for target architectures at deployment time. Our prototype demonstrates that new XaaS containers combine the convenience of containerization with the performance benefits of system-specialized builds.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis (SC'25)</p></details> |
| **[A High-performance Real-time Container File Monitoring Approach Based on Virtual Machine Introspection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16030v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As cloud computing continues to advance and become an integral part of modern IT infrastructure, container security has emerged as a critical factor in ensuring the smooth operation of cloud-native applications. An attacker can attack the service in the container or even perform the container escape attack by tampering with the files. Monitoring container files is important for APT detection and cyberspace security. Existing file monitoring methods are usually based on host operating system or virtual machine introspection to protect file security in real time. The methods based on the host operating system usually monitor file operations in the host operating system. However, when the container escapes to the host, the host operating system will no longer be secure, so these methods face the problem of weak security. Aiming at the problems of low security and high overload introduced in existing container file monitoring, a high-performance container file monitoring method based on virtual machine introspection is proposed. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively monitor the container files and introduce an acceptable monitoring overload.</p></details> |  |

We know that, for CQAC queries, the problem of testing containment is $\Pi_2 ^p$ -complete. However, there are broad classes of queries with semi-interval arithmetic comparisons in the containing query that render the problem solvable in NP. In all cases examined the contained query is allowed to be any CQAC. Interestingly, we also prove that there are simple cases where the problem remains $\Pi_2 ^p$ -complete. We also investigate the complexity of computing certain answers in the framework of answering CQAC queries with semi-interval comparisons using any CQAC views. We prove that maximally contained rewritings in the language of union of CQACs always compute exactly all certain answers. We find cases where we can compute certain answers in polynomial time using maximally contained rewritings.</p></details> | 71 pages 2 figures |
| **[Dstack: A Zero Trust Framework for Confidential Containers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11555v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Web3 applications require execution platforms that maintain confidentiality and integrity without relying on centralized trust authorities. While Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) offer promising capabilities for confidential computing, current implementations face significant limitations when applied to Web3 contexts, particularly in security reliability, censorship resistance, and vendor independence. This paper presents dstack, a comprehensive framework that transforms raw TEE technology into a true Zero Trust platform. We introduce three key innovations: (1) Portable Confidential Containers that enable seamless workload migration across heterogeneous TEE environments while maintaining security guarantees, (2) Decentralized Code Management that leverages smart contracts for transparent governance of TEE applications, and (3) Verifiable Domain Management that ensures secure and verifiable application identity without centralized authorities. These innovations are implemented through three core components: dstack-OS, dstack-KMS, and dstack-Gateway. Together, they demonstrate how to achieve both the performance advantages of VM-level TEE solutions and the trustless guarantees required by Web3 applications. Our evaluation shows that dstack provides comprehensive security guarantees while maintaining practical usability for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring and Exploiting the Resource Isolation Attack Surface of WebAssembly Containers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11242v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the WebAssembly (or Wasm) technology has been rapidly evolving, with many runtimes actively under development, providing cross-platform secure sandboxes for Wasm modules to run as portable containers. Compared with Docker, which isolates applications at the operating system level, Wasm runtimes provide more security mechanisms, such as linear memory, type checking, and protected call stacks. Although Wasm is designed with security in mind and considered to be a more secure container runtime, various security challenges have arisen, and researchers have focused on the security of Wasm runtimes, such as discovering vulnerabilities or proposing new security mechanisms to achieve robust isolation. However, we have observed that the resource isolation is not well protected by the current Wasm runtimes, and attackers can exhaust the host's resources to interfere with the execution of other container instances by exploiting the WASI/WASIX interfaces. And the attack surface has not been well explored and measured. In this paper, we explore the resource isolation attack surface of Wasm runtimes systematically by proposing several static Wasm runtime analysis approaches. Based on the analysis results, we propose several exploitation strategies to break the resource isolation of Wasm runtimes. The experimental results show that malicious Wasm instances can not only consume large amounts of system resources on their own but also introduce high workloads into other components of the underlying operating system, leading to a substantial performance degradation of the whole system. In addition, the mitigation approaches have also been discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 2 figures.

| **[ORCA: Unveiling Obscure Containers In The Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09322v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software development increasingly depends on open-source libraries and third-party components, which are often encapsulated into containerized environments. While improving the development and deployment of applications, this approach introduces security risks, particularly when outdated or vulnerable components are inadvertently included in production environments. Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is a critical process that helps identify and manage packages and dependencies inside a container. However, unintentional modifications to the container filesystem can lead to incomplete container images, which compromise the reliability of SCA tools. In this paper, we examine the limitations of both cloud-based and open-source SCA tools when faced with such obscure images. An analysis of 600 popular containers revealed that obscure containers exist in well-known registries and trusted images and that many tools fail to analyze such containers. To mitigate these issues, we propose an obscuration-resilient methodology for container analysis and introduce ORCA (Obscuration-Resilient Container Analyzer), its open-source implementation. We reported our findings to all vendors using their appropriate channels. Our results demonstrate that ORCA effectively detects the content of obscure containers and achieves a median 40% improvement in file coverage compared to Docker Scout and Syft.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unikernels vs. Containers: A Runtime-Level Performance Comparison for Resource-Constrained Edge Workloads](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07891v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The choice between containers and unikernels is a critical trade-off for edge applications, balancing the container's ecosystem maturity against unikernel's specialized efficiency. However, until now, how this trade-off behaves under the severe memory constraints of industrial edge environments remains insufficiently investigated, especially across different execution models. This work presents an empirical comparison using Go and Node.js applications, representing ahead-of-time (AOT) and just-in-time (JIT) compilation, respectively. While unikernels consistently deliver faster startup times and outperform containers for Go-based workloads in resource-constrained environments, the evaluation results identify a critical performance crossover for Node.js. Below a certain memory threshold, Docker containers maintain stable performance for both I/O-bound and CPU-bound applications, while the Nanos unikernel's performance degrades sharply. This reveals that Linux's memory management capabilities can outweigh the minimalist efficiency of unikernels under resource scarcity, a critical trade-off that, until now, has not been adequately quantified for JIT runtimes in this context. These findings demonstrate that the optimal deployment paradigm depends on both runtime behavior and available system resources, underscoring the need for workload-aware deployment strategies in edge computing.</p></details> |  |

Verifying the correctness of such upgrades remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a verification-based approach to ensure the correctness of the existing functionality in the upgraded version of a PLC software. The method converts the older and the newer versions of the sequential function chart (SFC) into two Petri net models. We then verify whether one model is contained within another, based on a novel containment checking algorithm grounded in symbolic path equivalence. For this purpose, we have developed a home-grown Petri net-based containment checker. Experimental evaluation on 80 real-world benchmarks from the OSCAT library highlights the scalability and effectiveness of the framework. We have compared our approach with verifAPS, a popular tool used for software upgradation, and observed nearly 4x performance improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages with appendix</p></details> |

Containment is determined through the generalized winding number (GWN), a mathematical construction that is indifferent to the arrangement of surfaces in the shape. Applying contemporary techniques for the 3D GWN to trimmed NURBS surfaces requires some form of geometric discretization, introducing computational inefficiency to the algorithm and even risking containment misclassifications near the surface. In contrast, our proposed method uses a novel reformulation of the relevant surface integral based on Stokes' theorem, which operates on the boundary and trimming curves as provided through rapidly converging adaptive quadrature. Batches of queries are further accelerated by memoizing (i.e.\ caching and reusing) quadrature node positions and tangents as they are evaluated. We demonstrate that our GWN method is robust to complex trimming geometry in a CAD model, and is accurate up to arbitrary precision at arbitrary distances from the surface. The derived containment query is therefore robust to model non-watertightness while respecting all curved features of the input shape.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 Pa...</summary><p>18 Pages, 16 Figures, 1 Table</p></details> |

To enable the secure development, execution, and deployment, of applications on TEE platforms, TEE containers have been introduced as middleware solutions. These containers aim to shield applications from potentially malicious operating systems and orchestration interfaces while maintaining usability and reliability. In this paper, we analyze the isolation strategies employed by existing TEE containers to protect secure applications. To address the challenges in analyzing these interfaces, we designed an automated analyzer to precisely identify and evaluate their isolation boundaries. We observed that some TEE containers fail to achieve their intended goals due to critical design and implementation flaws, such as information leakage, rollback attacks, denial-of-service, and Iago attacks, which pose significant security risks. Drawing from our findings, we share key lessons to guide the development of more secure container solutions and discuss emerging trends in TEE containerization design.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional RL faces challenges when dealing with complex, real-world constraints, especially when action space feasibility is explicit and dependent on the corresponding state or trajectory. In this work, we address stochastic sequential dynamic decision-making problems with state-dependent constraints. As a relevant and real-world case study, we focus on the master stowage planning problem in container shipping, which aims to optimize revenue and operational costs under demand uncertainty and operational constraints. We propose a deep RL framework with an encoder-decoder model and feasibility layers that satisfy convex constraints and maintain unbiased gradient flow, which embed problem instances, current solutions, and demand uncertainty to guide learning. Experiments show that our model efficiently finds adaptive, feasible solutions that generalize across varying distributions and scale to larger instances, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in constrained RL and stochastic programming. By uniting artificial intelligence and operations research, our policy empowers humans to make adaptive, uncertainty-aware decisions for resilient and sustainable planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review</p></details> |

In the United States, shipping ports link the domestic economy to global markets and are vital to sustain supply chain flow and economic stability. Maritime shipping accounts for nearly half of the U.S.'s annual international trade, two thirds of which are represented by container shipping. Previous studies highlighted the capability of automation in enhancing container processing; however, unlike in European and East Asian ports, full automation is limited in U.S. ports due to legal protections for human labor. Consequently, there is a need for alternative methods that deliver automation level efficiencies while maintaining the terms of cooperative agreements. This paper proposes an Intelligent Planning System (IPS) that applies the concept of Pareto Optimization to container yards through a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) based recursive appointment system. The results show an improvement from baseline for both daily terminal throughput volumes and processing times. The generated IPS can be employed to provide recommendations for container positioning and truck pickup appointments to optimize container yard layout and flow resulting in reduced realtime congestion and predictively mitigated future congestion.</p></details> | 19 pages |

The software is distributed both as native packages and specialized production containers. Following an approach used in other communities like web development, we built our workspaces, system-like containers to ease development and testing. Developers can change the source tree or check out a different branch and quickly reconfigure the services to see the effect of their changes. In this paper, we will talk about what differentiates workspaces from other containers. We will describe our base system, composed of three containers: a one-node cluster including a compute element and a batch system, a GlideinWMS Factory controlling pilot jobs, and a scheduler and Frontend to submit jobs and provision resources. Additional containers can be used for optional components. This system can easily run on a laptop, and we will share our evaluation of different container runtimes, with an eye for ease of use and performance. Finally, we will talk about our experience as developers and with students. The GlideinWMS workspaces are easily integrated with IDEs like VS Code, simplifying debugging and allowing development and testing of the system even when offline.

| **[Learning to See Inside Opaque Liquid Containers using Speckle Vibrometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20757v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer vision seeks to infer a wide range of information about objects and events. However, vision systems based on conventional imaging are limited to extracting information only from the visible surfaces of scene objects. For instance, a vision system can detect and identify a Coke can in the scene, but it cannot determine whether the can is full or empty. In this paper, we aim to expand the scope of computer vision to include the novel task of inferring the hidden liquid levels of opaque containers by sensing the tiny vibrations on their surfaces. Our method provides a first-of-a-kind way to inspect the fill level of multiple sealed containers remotely, at once, without needing physical manipulation and manual weighing. First, we propose a novel speckle-based vibration sensing system for simultaneously capturing scene vibrations on a 2D grid of points. We use our system to efficiently and remotely capture a dataset of vibration responses for a variety of everyday liquid containers. Then, we develop a transformer-based approach for analyzing the captured vibrations and classifying the container type and its hidden liquid level at the time of measurement. Our architecture is invariant to the vibration source, yielding correct liquid level estimates for controlled and ambient scene sound sources. Moreover, our model generalizes to unseen container instances within known classes (e.g., training on five Coke cans of a six-pack, testing on a sixth) and fluid levels. We demonstrate our method by recovering liquid levels from various everyday containers.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

The study introduces a binomial model for predicting the overlap between samples, demonstrating that it is both accurate and practical when sample sizes are small compared to the original sets. The paper compares this model to previous approaches and shows that it provides better estimates under the considered conditions. It also analyzes the statistical properties of the estimator, including error bounds and sample size requirements needed to achieve a desired level of accuracy and confidence. The framework is extended to estimate set similarity, and the paper provides guidance for applying these methods in large scale data systems where only partial or sampled data is available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finite element modeling of V-notched thermoelastic strain-limiting solids containing inclusions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09300v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A precise domain triangulation is recognized as indispensable for the accurate numerical approximation of differential operators within collocation methods, leading to a substantial reduction in discretization errors. An efficient finite element method (FEM) is presented in this paper, meticulously developed to solve a complex mathematical model. This model governs the behavior of thermoelastic solids containing both a V-notch and inclusions. The system of partial differential equations underlying this model consists of two primary components: a linear elliptic equation, which is used to describe the temperature distribution, and a quasilinear equation, which governs the mechanical behavior of the body. Through the application of this specifically tailored FEM, accurate and efficient solutions are able to be obtained for these intricate thermoelastic problems. The algebraically nonlinear constitutive equation, alongside the balance of linear momentum, is effectively reduced to a second-order quasi-linear elliptic partial differential equation. Complex curved boundaries are represented through the application of a smooth, distinctive point transformation. Furthermore, higher-order shape functions are employed to ensure the accurate computation of entries within the FEM matrices and vectors, from which a highly precise approximate solution to the BVP is subsequently obtained. The inherent nonlinearities in the governing differential equation are addressed through the implementation of a Picard-type linearization scheme.

The original development of containers is done in the internal language of locally cartesian closed categories (LCCCs) with disjoint coproducts and W-types, and uniqueness of identity proofs (UIP) is implicitly assumed throughout. Although it is claimed that these developments can also be interpreted in extensional Martin-L\"of type theory, this interpretation is not made explicit. In this paper, we present a formalisation of the results that 'containers preserve least and greatest fixed points' in Cubical Agda, thereby giving a formulation in intensional type theory. Our proofs do not make use of UIP and thereby generalise the original results from talking about container functors on Set to container functors on the wild category of types. Our main incentive for using Cubical Agda is that its path type restores the equivalence between bisimulation and coinductive equality. Thus, besides developing container theory in a more general setting, we also demonstrate the usefulness of Cubical Agda's path type to coinductive proofs.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages main text.

Not-contains is practically relevant, for instance in symbolic execution of string manipulating programs. Particularly, we show that the predicate $\neg\mathit{Contains}(x_1 \ldots x_n, y_1 \ldots y_m)$, where $x_1 \ldots x_n$ and $y_1 \ldots y_m$ are sequences of string variables constrained by regular languages, is decidable. Decidability of a not-contains predicate combined with chain-free word equations and regular membership constraints follows.</p></details> |  |

A typical service life for a container is more than 20 years. However, overtime containers suffer various types of damage due to the mechanical as well as natural factors. A damaged container is a safety hazard for the employees handling it and a liability for the logistic company. Therefore, a timely inspection and detection of the damaged container is a key for prolonging service life as well as avoiding safety hazards. In this paper, we will compare the performance of the damage detection by three state-of-the-art advanced computer vision models Yolov12, Yolov11 and RF-DETR. We will use a dataset of 278 annotated images to train, validate and test the model. We will compare the mAP and precision of the model. The objective of this paper is to identify the model that is best suited for container damage detection. The result is mixed. mAP@50 score of Yolov11 and 12 was 81.9% compared to RF-DETR, which was 77.7%. However, while testing the model for not-so-common damaged containers, the RF-DETR model outperformed the others overall, exhibiting superiority to accurately detecting both damaged containers as well as damage occurrences with high confidence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributive Laws of Monadic Containers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17191v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Containers are used to carve out a class of strictly positive data types in terms of shapes and positions. They can be interpreted via a fully-faithful functor into endofunctors on Set. Monadic containers are those containers whose interpretation as a Set functor carries a monad structure. The category of containers is closed under container composition and is a monoidal category, whereas monadic containers do not in general compose. In this paper, we develop a characterisation of distributive laws of monadic containers. Distributive laws were introduced as a sufficient condition for the composition of the underlying functors of two monads to also carry a monad structure. Our development parallels Ahman and Uustalu's characterisation of distributive laws of directed containers, i.e. containers whose Set functor interpretation carries a comonad structure. Furthermore, by combining our work with theirs, we construct characterisations of mixed distributive laws (i.e. of directed containers over monadic containers and vice versa), thereby completing the 'zoo' of container characterisations of (co)monads and their distributive laws. We have found these characterisations amenable to development of existence and uniqueness proofs of distributive laws, particularly in the mechanised setting of Cubical Agda, in which most of the theory of this paper has been formalised.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages main text, 4 pages appendices.

| **[DnR-nonverbal: Cinematic Audio Source Separation Dataset Containing Non-Verbal Sounds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02499v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new dataset for cinematic audio source separation (CASS) that handles non-verbal sounds. Existing CASS datasets only contain reading-style sounds as a speech stem. These datasets differ from actual movie audio, which is more likely to include acted-out voices. Consequently, models trained on conventional datasets tend to have issues where emotionally heightened voices, such as laughter and screams, are more easily separated as an effect, not speech. To address this problem, we build a new dataset, DnR-nonverbal. The proposed dataset includes non-verbal sounds like laughter and screams in the speech stem. From the experiments, we reveal the issue of non-verbal sound extraction by the current CASS model and show that our dataset can effectively address the issue in the synthetic and actual movie audio. Our dataset is available at https://zenodo.org/records/15470640.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Interspeech 2025, 5 pages, 3 figures, dataset is available at https://zenodo.org/records/15470640</p></details> |
| **[LRScheduler: A Layer-aware and Resource-adaptive Container Scheduler in Edge Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03694v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lightweight containers provide an efficient approach for deploying computation-intensive applications in network edge. The layered storage structure of container images can further reduce the deployment cost and container startup time. Existing researches discuss layer sharing scheduling theoretically but with little attention paid to the practical implementation. To fill in this gap, we propose and implement a Layer-aware and Resource-adaptive container Scheduler (LRScheduler) in edge computing. Specifically, we first utilize container image layer information to design and implement a node scoring and container scheduling mechanism. This mechanism can effectively reduce the download cost when deploying containers, which is very important in edge computing with limited bandwidth. Then, we design a dynamically weighted and resource-adaptive mechanism to enhance load balancing in edge clusters, increasing layer sharing scores when resource load is low to use idle resources effectively. Our scheduler is built on the scheduling framework of Kubernetes, enabling full process automation from task information acquisition to container dep=loyment. Testing on a real system has shown that our design can effectively reduce the container deployment cost as compared with the default scheduler.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 10 figures, The 20th International Conference on Mobility, Sensing and Networking (MSN 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Bag Semantics Query Containment: The CQ vs. UCQ Case and Other Stories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07219v3)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Query Containment Problem (QCP) is a fundamental decision problem in query processing and optimization. While QCP has for a long time been completely understood for the case of set semantics, decidability of QCP for conjunctive queries under multi-set semantics ($QCP_{\text{CQ}}^{\text{bag}}$) remains one of the most intriguing open problems in database theory. Certain effort has been put, in last 30 years, to solve this problem and some decidable special cases of $QCP_{\text{CQ}}^{\text{bag}}$ were identified, as well as some undecidable extensions, including $QCP_{\text{UCQ}}^{\text{bag}}$. In this paper we introduce a new technique which produces, for a given UCQ $\Phi$, a CQ $\phi$ such that the application of $\phi$ to a database $D$ is, in some sense, an approximation of the application of $\Phi$ to $D$. Using this technique we could analyze the status of $QCP^{\text{bag}}$ when one of the queries in question is a CQ and the other is a UCQ, and we reached conclusions which surprised us a little bit. We also tried to use this technique to translate the known undecidability proof for $QCP_{\text{UCQ}}^{\text{bag}}$ into a proof of undecidability of $QCP_{\text{CQ}}^{\text{bag}}$. And, as you are going to see, we got stopped just one infinitely small $\varepsilon$ before reaching this ultimate goal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Expan...</summary><p>Expanded explanations to provide better intuitions</p></details> |

However, the rapid adoption of container technologies introduces significant security challenges that require careful management. This paper investigates key areas of container security, including runtime protection, network safeguards, configuration best practices, supply chain security, and comprehensive monitoring and logging solutions. We identify common vulnerabilities within these domains and provide actionable recommendations to address and mitigate these risks. By integrating security throughout the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), organizations can reinforce their security posture, creating a resilient and reliable containerized application infrastructure that withstands evolving threats.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient isogeometric Boundary Element simulation of elastic domains containing thin inclusions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19170v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper is concerned with the Boundary Element simulation of elastic domains that contain thin inclusions that have elastic material properties, which are different to the domain. With thin inclusions we mean inclusions with extreme aspect ratios, i.e. where one dimension is much smaller than the other ones. Examples of this are reinforcements in civil/mechanical engineering or concrete linings in underground construction. The fact that an inclusion has an extreme aspect ratio poses a challenge to the numerical integration of the arising singular integrals and novel approaches are presented to deal with it. Several examples demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed methods and show that the results are in good agreement with analytical and other numerical solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 22 figures, 1 appendix</p></details> |
| **[Containment for Guarded Monotone Strict NP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01254v4)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Guarded Monotone Strict NP (GMSNP) extends Monotone Monadic Strict NP (MMSNP) by guarded existentially quantified predicates of arbitrary arities. We prove that the containment problem for GMSNP is decidable, thereby settling an open question of Bienvenu, ten Cate, Lutz, and Wolter, later restated by Bourhis and Lutz. Our proof also comes with a 2NEXPTIME upper bound on the complexity of the problem, which matches the lower bound for containment of MMSNP due to Bourhis and Lutz. In order to obtain these results, we significantly improve the state of knowledge of the model-theoretic properties of GMSNP. Bodirsky, Kn\"{a}uer, and Starke previously showed that every GMSNP sentence defines a finite union of CSPs of $\omega$-categorical structures. We show that these structures can be used to obtain a reduction from the containment problem for GMSNP to the much simpler problem of testing the existence of a certain map called recolouring, albeit in a more general setting than GMSNP; a careful analysis of this yields said upper bound. As a secondary contribution, we refine the construction of Bodirsky, Kn\"{a}uer, and Starke by adding a restricted form of homogeneity to the properties of these structures, making the logic amenable to future complexity classifications for query evaluation using techniques developed for infinite-domain CSPs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extending the Control Plane of Container Orchestrators for I/O Virtualization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06041v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single Root Input/Output Virtualization (SR-IOV) is a standard technology for forking a single PCI express device and providing it to applications while ensuring performance isolation. It enables container orchestrators to share a limited number of physical network interfaces without incurring significant virtualization overhead. The allocation of virtualized network devices to containers, however, needs to be more configurable based on the bandwidth needs of running applications. Moreover, container orchestrators' network control over the virtualized interfaces is limited by the abilities of SR-IOV. We explore the design considerations for a system with controlled SR-IOV virtualization and present ConRDMA, a novel architecture that enables fine control of RDMA virtualization for containers. Our evaluation shows that ConRDMA enables containers to use RDMA allocated bandwidth more efficiently and to select best-suited nodes to meet their varying communication requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Performance Characterization of Containers in Edge Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02082v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Edge computing addresses critical limitations of cloud computing such as high latency and network congestion by decentralizing processing from cloud to the edge. However, the need for software replication across heterogeneous edge devices introduces dependency and portability challenges, driving the adoption of containerization technologies like Docker. While containers offer lightweight isolation and deployment advantages, they introduce new bottlenecks in edge environments, including cold-start delays, memory constraints, network throughput variability, and inefficient IO handling when interfacing with embedded peripherals. This paper presents an empirical evaluation of Docker containers on resource-constrained edge devices, using Raspberry Pi as a representative platform. We benchmark performance across diverse workloads, including microbenchmarks (CPU, memory, network profiling) and macrobenchmarks (AI inference, sensor IO operations), to quantify the overheads of containerization in real-world edge scenarios. Our testbed comprises physical Raspberry Pi nodes integrated with environmental sensors and camera modules, enabling measurements of latency, memory faults, IO throughput, and cold start delays under varying loads. Key findings reveal trade-offs between container isolation and edge-specific resource limitations, with performance degradation observed in IO heavy and latency sensitive tasks. We identify configuration optimizations to mitigate these issues, providing actionable insights for deploying containers in edge environments while meeting real time and reliability requirements. This work advances the understanding of containerized edge computing by systematically evaluating its feasibility and pitfalls on low-power embedded systems.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces the SCU-Hand (Soft Conical Universal Robot Hand), a novel end-effector designed to automate the task of scooping powdered samples from various container sizes using a robotic arm. The SCU-Hand employs a flexible, conical structure that adapts to different container geometries through deformation, maintaining consistent contact without complex force sensing or machine learning-based control methods. Its reconfigurable mechanism allows for size adjustment, enabling efficient scooping from diverse container types. By combining soft robotics principles with a sheet-morphing design, our end-effector achieves high flexibility while retaining the necessary stiffness for effective powder manipulation. We detail the design principles, fabrication process, and experimental validation of the SCU-Hand. Experimental validation showed that the scooping capacity is about 20% higher than that of a commercial tool, with a scooping performance of more than 95% for containers of sizes between 67 mm to 110 mm. This research contributes to laboratory automation by offering a cost-effective, easily implementable solution for automating tasks such as materials synthesis and characterization processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA2025).

| **[Optimizing Intra-Container Communication with Memory Protection Keys: A Novel Approach to Secure and Efficient Microservice Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07836v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern cloud-native applications, microservices are commonly deployed in containerized environments to ensure scalability and flexibility. However, inter-process communication (IPC) between co-located microservices often suffers from significant overhead, especially when traditional networking protocols are employed within containers. This paper introduces a novel approach, MPKLink, leveraging Intel Memory Protection Keys (MPK) to enhance intra-container communication efficiency while ensuring security. By utilizing shared memory with MPK-based access control, we eliminate unnecessary networking latencies, leading to reduced resource consumption and faster response times. We present a comprehensive evaluation of MPKLink, demonstrating its superior performance over conventional methods such as REST and gRPC within microservice architectures. Furthermore, we explore the integration of this approach with existing container orchestration platforms, showcasing its seamless adoption in real-world deployment scenarios. This work provides a transformative solution for developers looking to optimize communication in microservices while maintaining the integrity and security of containerized applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Integrated optimization of operations and capacity planning under uncertainty for drayage procurement in container logistics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01808v1)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an integrated framework for truckload procurement in container logistics, bridging strategic and operational aspects that are often treated independently in existing research. Drayage, the short-haul trucking of containers, plays a critical role in intermodal container logistics. Using dynamic programming, we identify optimal operational policies for allocating drayage volumes among capacitated carriers under uncertain container flows and spot rates. The computational complexity of optimization under uncertainty is mitigated through sample average approximation. These optimal policies serve as the basis for evaluating specific capacity arrangements. To optimize capacity reservations with strategic and spot carriers, we employ an efficient quasi-Newton method. Numerical experiments demonstrate significant cost-efficiency improvements, including a 21.2% cost reduction in a four-period scenario. Monte Carlo simulations further highlight the strong generalization capabilities of the proposed joint optimization method across out-of-sample scenarios. These findings underscore the importance of integrating strategic and operational decisions to enhance cost efficiency in truckload procurement under uncertainty.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Dimensioning of Frequency Containment Reserves: The Case of the Nordic Grid](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11093v2)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the main responsibilities of a Transmission System Operator (TSO) operating an electric grid is to maintain a designated frequency (e.g., 50 Hz in Europe). To achieve this, TSOs have created several products called frequency-supporting ancillary services. The Frequency Containment Reserve (FCR) is one of these ancillary service products. This article focuses on the TSO problem of determining the volume procured for FCR. Specifically, we investigate the potential benefits and impact on grid security when transitioning from a traditionally \textit{static} procurement method to a \textit{dynamic} strategy for FCR volume. We take the Nordic synchronous area in Europe as a case study and use a diffusion model to capture its frequency development. We introduce a controlled mean reversal parameter to assess changes in FCR obligations, in particular for the Nordic FCR-N ancillary service product. We establish closed-form expressions for exceedance probabilities and use historical frequency data as input to calibrate the model. We show that a dynamic dimensioning approach for FCR has the potential to significantly reduce the exceedance probabilities (up to $37\%$) while maintaining the total yearly procured FCR volume equal to that of the current static approach. Alternatively, a dynamic dimensioning approach could significantly increase security at limited extra cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 12 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Power Systems</p></details> |
